yes , good day mean , ladies , gentlemen .
it . thank you for the invitation here today to talk .
and i got me , now reflects back to imagine .
my name is christian <unk> and i 'm going to strange fact that term , <unk> at the city of food .
that are called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is : one skies , two , the organization , and thirdly , the public policy .
so i 'm for the <unk> this city in charge .
and you know that makes you 're not very popular .
i know .
and beyond , and that 's what my son , particularly liked , i also <unk> .
that means that i 'm the head of the <unk> pole .
<unk> <unk> and a kilometer <unk> .
and have i thought , is a subject matter , with me tell you today <unk> want .
because the subject of <unk> , because , that belongs to the north pole .
we hope for the best and prepare ourselves on the worst , and that 's what jack seat , once said .
you know him .
he was once in general <unk> .
and then i 'm starting to do n't quite as the matter to say .
i <unk> you a position .
so we speak , if it sort of a risk is that we just before a disaster , stop , for example <unk> <unk> , the rush .
many people are driving .
it will push , it <unk> .

nobody seems to belong .
the suitcase can hear anybody .
suddenly a <unk> .
leave you that <unk> .
the police comes to fire department , <unk> .
people scream .
officials <unk> .
, get out .
what ? to ask passersby .
that we ca n't either neoconservativism or we ca n't it 's say .
the people leave the building .
so to cry .
some of theirs , and perhaps , because it all very quickly go .
a sudden , gossip .
there 's <unk> inside .
a panic is breaking out .
i hear now here on .
the rest <unk> i your imagination .
but it 's no fantasy , that i <unk> 've . <unk> ?
this is this , in this week is happening in <unk> .
there 's such a suitcase , you 're staying .
later turned out that only , in <unk> , nine billion pounds of drugs at it was .
but the people were just like , and that has a friend told me that tells , from the building , forced .
it was n't say .
and it was that same kind of gossip , at least in the pack up , my friend in my friend , this software .
god , unless you what is n't panic for eating , otherwise would all the pressures not as benign dated them how it seems .
you see , in a <unk> , in a <unk> disaster is communication in a very important .
communication is so important , because the people in this situation is literally for communications <unk> .
they want to know what 's because it .
once in the good , ancient times was that for the authorities , pretty simple .
we 've just do n't have said , or we 've got lied .
why ?
because the so-called <unk> elder care .

this is in a period of social media , in a period of twitter , in a period of facebook , in a period of private and public <unk> , in a period of of and public television is no longer possible .
simply and emotional , therefore , because it does n't be moral is , and secondly , mostly are anyway , we the past when the agency , across the event that report .
you remember , maybe even at the passenger in the hudson river , is a few year , and forth .
the first reporting on it arrived at twitter .

this was n't <unk> .
you see , we 're going to rely , today , which simply and intense of <unk> the truth to say , and very <unk> to inform .
because usually we 're obviously also the past , the benchmark of the fact you know , because we as the agency need to make sure enough attention , we just <unk> information to pass .
what are public media , or as private media , or not so much thought , or they do it also not .
of so , we 're going into food , and that 's also something that 's ever been through the media has gone are , we think about how we in the future with <unk> deal .
and that we going to the good old siren , back out .
however , just as a form of <unk> .
that means we 're going to the next few years about 100 siren , in the <unk> to put in the , some of you know that , <unk> , if it 's how to <unk> coming .
once it was so .
you may know you know , what times more quickly , once in short , once a long , and even after that means .
i know it 's no longer .
we 're that today <unk> with all <unk> that we here , have , so <unk> , on facebook , on twitter , the radio <unk> too late night , the telly and at all over the internet and the local media and so forth and immediately , in bandages of course , with <unk> to end of information forward to get .
and we know , we need to get there is very quickly and <unk> operate and we need to get there is very quickly and <unk> inform them , because the <unk> and citizens to be otherwise <unk> .
and we ultimately , no longer this to believe what we tell you want .
communication in the crisis , or in the disaster is so one , a question of fast about all media , apply to , and it 's also a question of its credibility .
the credibility that 's our biggest problem , because the <unk> and citizens to say , either , oh , the companies exaggerated , once again , right , you do n't , or they say , the <unk> us , it 's anything worse than it is in real .
we have therefore , too bad experiences has done with facebook and twitter , still long ago .
well that you have some of in them on the media coverage .
we have a bigger <unk> into food <unk> had .
and that as a call these chemical bomb .
that are bombs that with a <unk> equipped are , because they are supposed once did n't look at the first <unk> the <unk> explode , it by the houses in war ii <unk> and just at ground , due to chemically function that triggered by going to a little metal , the <unk> <unk> two <unk> of another and separated the , <unk> , and then it came to blast .
this problem is just , many of the suitcase bombs 've never works and they 're looking like , in <unk> among them into food <unk> .
and there , we were from an older gentleman , the be a conscience , he 's so beautiful in the scientific protocol , i said , easier to , we were now , he had seen as you <unk> forty-three like it 's and now <unk> he 's the authorities to be informed that 's a bomb that lies . left the back ,
the way since , a number one elderly gentleman reported in the whole <unk> .
we 'll see , what we 'll find everything .
these suitcase bombs to get away from a place , not have defused the will , they did implode , will .
and so we then in <unk> park , which simply and intense an , in the literal way of the word , a bomb <unk> .
and saw in history of the city , all of communication across from facebook and twitter , going to do with the consequence of the entire <unk> far over <unk> <unk> total of accenture model .
and the media was thrilled . laughter in the background .
we did n't even with where neuronal cell phone , who have <unk> and <unk> , all over <unk> and twitter .
all this was a great effect for us , because the credibility that 's , demonstrable increased about these social media .
just so , they have to me , signs be , when i quit while i do .
i can go from here 's not at the clock of watching .
this is the credibility and so , because the first of these social media for the advantage we have to you very much information to pass .
not so much <unk> are , because the members that there are tweeting right the <unk> , how she calls , a high <unk> have .
secondly , fast corrections .
if anything not true , writes that someone who immediately , so the credibility that , i just 've talked to significantly increase , because it 's the entire community in principle of the reports are involved .
and it 's a very high <unk> therefore , so if anything that 's wrong , then it can also very quickly <unk> be .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> that 's exciting , learned how a bomb , in <unk> park , up goes .
of so we from all the things that in the last happen are , and there are much more <unk> happens when <unk> an even think , as <unk> a third .
well , the city of food that every day of such a disaster home -- looking to be .
a bomb , in implode must be in a park , it 's certainly not such a .
but you can also , after <unk> we now , in <unk> be found and then i am , we see there with our <unk> and try to the in seven feet <unk> .
and if the , if you see in munich , you think about other cities , if the then did implode must be , because it 's called a <unk> has to you take conventional or not to defuse that , then we know , right now , be a variety of houses and then , look like before .
and that to communicate it 's important , one , because it 's in a in a world <unk> <unk> rate is necessary to communicate to run , but also be freaked out to prevent them to do n't worry about to carry that the people getting informed are to do n't worry about to carry that the people are capable of , to these difficult situation priority .
and the social media to help us , and to be believable , to be , because ultimately , they all of the communications are involved , and it 's not just a <unk> <unk> is how we play in the <unk> , <unk> and certainly not even in the <unk> for much of had .
of so now is <unk> not just a bit of the authorities , not just a bit of the department , or the <unk> , of <unk> , the <unk> , red cross et <unk> , communication in the catastrophe and <unk> a catastrophe about us all of .
and <unk> this has been .
there 's on twitter and on facebook , a lot of help you walk , if you also partially of you still so overwhelmed with was , because suddenly <unk> of people have any <unk> build wanted , and you did n't even more , where the <unk> .
this picture , there 's still a lot to do , also for the public communication in <unk> , but the unprecedented , solidarity with the <unk> and the <unk> has just demonstrated that the social media from a <unk> , from a communication , no longer the way to think are .

thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> different .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , you have heard .
and i 'm not just as well , and , a personal <unk> to create .
what it 's me to go there <unk> produce 'm going on that i 'll ask you also a moment ago .
before i do that , i have but a few things <unk> .
first is , , i believe that we stories that you want to life needs .
that we have stories about it could live .
moreover , i believe that 's very much more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories , there , as of the entertainment in order to be .
then i think , that the internet , the infinite sprawl , of fact that well as anyone <unk> really properly . <unk> will .
and fourth , i 'm <unk> of confident that people do we were created , to be creative .
and that you happier , are , once you can be creative , anywhere .
more people are happy , even stronger than that 's the world .
it logically .
these better world is now , however , just a byproduct .
in primarily i 'm going to have said , a storyteller .
and the story that i tell you want to begin to look at midnight , in a <unk> , just happy <unk> sung by .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> birthday .
now she receive lots of that <unk> and the singing , not so much with , because in the moment , where it at midnight 's gone , something happens with her .
it 's something in your mind , in your body , with their perception .
and she did n't real word for .
they do n't know , what 's happening .
i 've all the same word for .
i call that the wizard of <unk> .
you see the one hand <unk> and toto in <unk> and everything is very white .
i got 'em feel that i 'm sort of a really <unk> .
<unk> .
and the other hand we have the two and then in my aching oz -- with all very much color .
and it was here , so first told that i 'd better <unk> and writing , that i draw .
so the first of , what <unk> now with their new perceptions see that 's an alien man with <unk> <unk> hair , before she says , you very serious look , `` congratulations , your life is over .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> about it up to keep them to a very special kind of people heard .
she was <unk> born .
players are people that wipe off your <unk> you 've reached about their lifetime , play .
who of you know <unk> ?
very good .
you can think of the <unk> at <unk> n't swords , if you stack together , but <unk> from the pocket .
so a cube , <unk> , <unk> , everything .
what really important is , the players have n't see on their <unk> .
we know , not , when we die .
i wish that every a long life , but we know what 's just not .
it can make tomorrow also all already passed his .
and consequently , it 's in my players , so .
you know what 's not just to get much you should really can play .
that means , again , which has lost a minute , the last have been to be .
a player , his entire lifetime , maybe playfulness is , <unk> the moment of <unk> as a candle that <unk> will .
now you can be natural wonder : if that because this is dangerous , why are the then place ?
the answer is clearly , this .
without play , without any players around a around , <unk> , all of gray , and only when a player does play , he 's actually alive .
that were to get born .
so .
this story of <unk> and how they 're going on the world of gamers <unk> , your first challenge and turns out of course , inevitably step into <unk> love , this is the story that i tell you want .
and that story in a <unk> .
the first season has 12 to follow , sorry i 'm here is a <unk> happens , i just too late 've seen .
so , twelve follow the first season with a certain length of each spent five to seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , an outcome after the other , beautiful <unk> told that you know .
that television set you 've seen in his <unk> anything else .
this is not news .
and if it 's all be , if only ' i 'm one is unstoppable .
and also not here .
now , okay , but the races .
we go again , <unk> back .
what 's the most famous sentence of the movie or from the pbs series ?
it can just a charitable giving , right .
thanks .
as if we practiced that would .
and so that knocks on my players , which is not too .
of which is it 's all kinds of them .
there was so many different games .
you think of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so forth and so on .
and so just <unk> 's also the number of gamers .
and consequently , you 're here , lots of stories that all be told you want .
now would be the next question : who do that , because all share ?
i got 'em , a pretty extraordinary amount of view of me .
i 'm giving me for sufficient smart and extremely creative .
but i know that 's a hundred brain , no longer producing as one , it 's mine .
so it came right to the idea that you the crowd , with the creative process <unk> .
what would , if we <unk> not just <unk> or giving , but even <unk> ?
so if you say , we invite you very very much , the development of this <unk> with mann .
you can think , for example , in the result , three would appear one <unk> on , they really neat to find , because he would you for example of her grandfather was reminded me .
and they 're a shepherd 's a fan of <unk> .
if you can now just , with the modern technology is that yes , no longer so hard to a <unk> do .
and that they invite the <unk> up , where it , right , and this is really cool <unk> , the really interested in the audience gasses .
that it 's not anywhere among , but it goes into the right there , where it ends up to .
this really nice thing is that we the internet .
and the internet , you know , really do anything .
so , every medium is kind of interactions .
that means you as viewers , you can write , drawing , spin , whatever they do want .
and if we 're also again this structure through .
that looks <unk> bit of <unk> net , right ?
so this <unk> , what common set up being .
and i 'm really <unk> believe that , that the internet was born in the same kind of these stories to tell .
it just doing , do n't yet , so many , <unk> absolutely no one .
so , you go , `` i but even a step further and leave the audiences express ourselves to the players are .
because in a <unk> .
there can be able to become characters from the series of ours , against people in the real environment , well , and this <unk> on your phone .
<unk> dative , you know it also informs us a very well , are something like a mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> entertainment .
these amazing areas , just very rapidly evolve .
and the i do n't responsive to be , because i would just 20 minutes i would need .
we cut out once put together .
everybody 's time off of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> and then we do this <unk> .
with this <unk> i could actually manufacture of the jury of the moment , i have the brink of the occurrence , <unk> innovation <unk> convince them .
the have to me the price for the best <unk> been .
and i need to say , that jury , which consisted of officials from the bank , of the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so a reasonable , they would you think .
and if i want to convince you can , here with my : the internet right to use <unk> structures to revolutionize the way , even better world , then i think , i can actually anyone to convince them .
so .
everybody 's just turn : why is this whole , like ?
because i 've left alone in the names all sectors , covered by side .
we have of course , first of the <unk> , who 's an element , my turn , you 're off , everybody 's just observed .
of course , that die .
in the pbs series is very much crash .
everybody 's time off , which means everybody must never even die .
and then of course , `` everybody 's just observed in terms of everyone can be part , when he 's like .
this is mine waste matter .
i come on one of the <unk> and there 's nothing worse , i think , as if it 's a <unk> will .
i do n't know , if you know .
if you in the theater , and then it 's the actor , so in the auditorium and all this : oh , you 're not me .
and this is it 's not .
so it is voluntary organizations interact .
and nobody has .
he can also just the viewer can be .
the reason i german , speaking is that the entire project , the german , will be , yeah .
that has also a few reasons .
i 'm with this project <unk> while , along and i was kept asking : go all this , but in english , target became larger , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that i can just say , the german <unk> is the third largest the world .
the <unk> is the english , then it 's the spanish , and then the german .
now it 's not so , when i would we in any little <unk> move .
furthermore think i really actually really , if it also other people that 's like me that the people to be grateful to be for something that 's not by any <unk> <unk> was , where the end , then everybody <unk> and every pun <unk> been .

and if you 're wondering , why i because now i 'm here at a <unk> , where it 's put under the headline <unk> <unk> <unk> process .
that i also a few ideas .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also very reliant on of <unk> and <unk> .
a few <unk> were also , and <unk> .
and i can really just say that all know , incredibly important is , and incredibly <unk> .
but it uses , it 's nothing to having a 's not apply them .
and my project is just <unk> thing where i just going away everything i 've , what i 'm so i 've learned .
and it applied .
and continue running that 's good .
i can really just say .
so , if you now , somebody sits around : i 'd have been my bit contribute , i had 19 degrees ' one idea <unk> character or i got 'em ai n't work <unk> cartoon , or whatever , that 's also have already now .
you find ourselves , the internet .
on facebook .
great , like releasing the speaker to talk .
yes , <unk> ' i also .
welcome to : you can memories are wiping out ?
question of them .
you can memories are wiping out ?
now you , because of all remember , which in your life ever 's happened ?
they still <unk> mind ?
who has who they can even at all remind me ?
it go to do n't hands up .
so you memories are wiping out ?
apparently been .
thank you .
no , it , let 's us today is n't do .
but if the talk about what would be pretty soon .
another good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk about tonight , i 've chosen , because he 's two of my passions , or my two large , i dabble in the moment , connect .
i got 'em all over here in the near <unk> studied and 'em my room with the bits and of bytes of busy , the right now this tall by the world to fly .
and <unk> certain time i 'm also now as a coach , and training in private lives , vocational field hides his way .
the one hand , i got so , well , very much more engaged , on the other hand , i 'm currently working in the human <unk> <unk> <unk> , so what is because this is that the human beings ?
, because that change ?
the to a comparison opposition .
i was recently in a very interesting discussion of artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so , the question was : when we can , when , when we can build a computer , yes , so how the human brain ?
so , and i <unk> ' there are we already quite close .
so i <unk> ' so two , three hundred years , longevity does n't that anymore .
but they let me just awful , why do that 's why that maybe <unk> it needs .
so the analogy between the computer on the one hand , and our brains to the other side .
if we the computer taking , then based , everything , so your smart , their tablets , you <unk> and also these cameras and all of intelligent refrigerators somewhere on <unk> little chip .
he is the cpu , central <unk> <unk> .
these are parts collection of <unk> transistors .
the word has 've probably one belongs and in <unk> it will always so as a triangle , intersect .

in our computer in our cpu , we have , i got 'em extra <unk> ago or five hundred million of these little pieces .
and the turn it 's managed to mess .

more he ca n't .
he 's actually quite a nerdy side .
let 's just comparing with our brains .
our brain , as the smallest unit of the neuron , the neuron , and we have them , well , i <unk> , a hundred billion , and a hundred billion neurons are in our gray matter of the amount up here in .
this beautiful but is , we are neurons have not only three fundamental connections , but the have to <unk> each neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of , just because it 's beautiful , is 10 trillion .
that are tens of fourteen zeros <unk> .
so , because you see , the complexity of the brain is the very much higher than that which we 're now , as a computer virus .
we want to the <unk> time for contrast , maybe the one or even know , of the first supercomputer that had their own power station a skinny on , ha , the <unk> , and with the <unk> the <unk> was the campus <unk> <unk> .
our <unk> <unk> even sometimes , but the box up here it takes about 20 watts .
and of is the oyster , the equivalent of two big selling bananas , so more you do n't and you your computer up there 's wonderful .
if we now <unk> freaking good part up here , <unk> freaking great computers with <unk> , why we 're using the then not , why we remember that we then things ?
maybe if you know the one or another this view on the internet , so , the person , uses only 10 percent of his brain , buy it now this <unk> to <unk> brain to be .
and <unk> there <unk> , the commercials have a bit .
ten percent , perhaps , but our brain is yes , in the course of our evolution , at this mass <unk> , that was very well , <unk> smaller , in the middle there is not yet our <unk> with warm , everything else , <unk> building .
that 's probably not to happen because we do n't use .
why it seems to then that we the most part of <unk> let me ?
maybe you know the notion of <unk> ?
of i 'll compare one of time , so beautiful with the iceberg , if you the iceberg see , in the ocean , then the oyster , got up so the top , then there 's the ocean , bottom of it 's a <unk> .
and these 10 percent above that are this is that 's what our plc , our <unk> mind is , <unk> goes , nine-tenths percent , running a shepherd <unk> off , <unk> .
we <unk> the statement step <unk> step <unk> step <unk> step <unk> <unk> slow <unk> step <unk> creative industry .
and the time <unk> on this memory back , maybe if you know the one or other people with <unk> memory .
people , so , much more detail can remember when i do n't got 'em up in the situation <unk> , and the story was then <unk> , i got 'em all said yes , but it , but , where you know that ?
this is , there 's very , there 's a particular , called a <unk> , so anybody with <unk> , somebody the most on a field <unk> , the awards , is that has a so good <unk> memory , it was in a plane , and screwing around , in a plane , in a helicopter , such as an oyster , he then ow `` no , over rome effectively went , rome to view , so rome that is yes , now . ow `` it’s not necessarily the smallest one city , and then in front of a giant signs of the sheet became obsessed , and has started to rome to draw .
and that 's not a way , so here , so the river , and there an oyster , that , no , every home , every single door , and every window has he once , he <unk> , it could go back to put on paper .
how does now this ?
so why ca of this , why we ca n't that , well , the presumption , is perhaps pretty close to the <unk> bit more access to , nine-tenths of <unk> .
now we 're using the well , but why i can not going on the at the <unk> night , remember , in the details of ?

he has even for example , in the law enforcement work and it with a rape survivor who worked , who had her experience is completely eliminated that was no more of al-qaeda , that <unk> <unk> by the brain , that 's not going on , this is gone .
wonderful , so that came the very clear .
now about , but it , the people <unk> to do .
because it in a very safe session , at the end or after this event <unk> can , even if you no more active to remind you could , she could then the hallmark of cars and know , where these people <unk> , that was n't <unk> , that was n't fifty meters on .
and actually is with the hallmark of the victim got caught .
the second thing i really wonderful thought , was , he has a lady in <unk> had that has told that her mother always embarrass her to alice in wonderland , and i read , when she was little , so four years .
there was watching them on your lap her mother and her mother has been reading .
and then he does she said , in a trance , acute care , but the time ago .
then she have begun <unk> , she was four days when they have that is , they could then we have n't read , today can do you .
and then they said , he said , i tell me , the <unk> .
they 've actually a specimen from alice in wonderland found , where that on this side of text which said , the queen , and i read it .
the brain , so this page as she was <unk> , as a picture .
and then she could read .
so yes , we actually have access to this , but we seem to because in ordinary lives we say <unk> kind <unk> to have to us not to <unk> .
, now stored and we know , not that event , in fact , but how <unk> have said , he got one in a picture i saw , a , a <unk> , we can store , rather , our <unk> , so that which we see that i 'm going to smell , that , what we hear that , what we taste and that which we feel , hey , if you 're now <unk> at a yellow <unk> think and how it 's really <unk> <unk> , they <unk> sense , of smoking tastes , <unk> example .
and , it was now <unk> long evening , put them , <unk> comfortable down , ha , <unk> bit upright and , then i must ask you , close it 's just very quickly affects your eyes .
and you remember on a very to experiences positive social event in recent past , yes .
you take the first , what happens .
and , if you that 's going to let 's going to be skills that you to this memory , a visual part of get .
you might be a picture , maybe as a movie ?
spectator play falls that does n't start on , because we do n't that normally do , but that they do i first occurred .
and if you see that , then it be that they 're either in the movie are , from their eyes , all experience , or how they are unable to see on a canvas .
this one , we call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you , you can at the mind back to solve , we get the eyes , again , of comparably ambitious .
who has because a visual information , let 's hand up ?

well , do 'official ' <unk> on .
<unk> what it is beautiful , of memories , if you memories <unk> , you know , not just this memory in high , <unk> <unk> sense to think that we <unk> a positive social event , and i got 'em , the one or other babies smile can see , there was so , that was beautiful , there were , yes , they laugh , is the memory , maybe there , actually save us with our memories , beautiful or other feelings .
and now here 's what poses .
<unk> all been before , well , our brain power of the spot , no difference between what we actually reminded , and the , what we just imagine , what we have conceived .
well that you can test , if you to home <unk> sit and you do something in the future , imagine that 's not yet happened is , they 're similar information , like something , if you 're clinging to do n't remember , what the past .
and , , you know , but surely those stories that you that tells us in <unk> round , of time .


<unk> , when i came to me it my uncle is a picture , i showed up from his hut and in switzerland .
a very nice image , it 's also a very beautiful shack .

and why do we do that 's not with our own thoughts , our own external memories , hey , what it bothers me , because , if i think that even more fun doing , at what i think it 's degree i think ?
they 've actually the artistic liberty in their own thoughts .
<unk> you know that they say , that you see the morning , if you just like this gray have eyes , what ?
yes , i got 'em , at sleep , i went out of the <unk> through the head .
really all the night and this idea what made me , it .
i think it 's around the he made the idea was n't go .
the son <unk> friend of me <unk> little depressed , when he went to germany was , because his mother in <unk> remained , and he did you just awful missed .
what the father has done , so he has to each night with the son would sit and has said , or has been wondering , so , which was that most beautiful , what 's happening today ?
what was that most beautiful , somewhere , and then it 's got him tell me , it <unk> let , it was just tell me , which is a wonderful happened .
and , rubber skylights got two weeks about the son therapy .
and then it was also okay , the <unk> way is that 's going back to visit .
and the is today , that 's at all the youth of made of the is today one of <unk> people that i know .
there are not so the memories , shaping the way that we are , but it 's our focus on , our focus on what i thought we use .
and how much energy we do n't waste , or use .
so if you <unk> <unk> thought <unk> or say , that was now here : ow , that 's so , <unk> this practice , `` i but actually do n't , then make it 's just like , you know , tom cruise in this <unk> fiction movies , it this , that these <unk> computer , where he did the files <unk> <unk> , they do that 's also time , you look for her image that <unk> have of this , well , not quite as a blemish on a have to tell you , yes , well , <unk> now <unk> happens , but , <unk> , way to .
what ham , we because <unk> ' yet , ah , what 's nice , yes <unk> time , <unk> , yes , that 's got me <unk> ' real love , gee , that was that was beautiful , right ?
and then they assume that 's time with .
they assume that with in your <unk> and they let 's <unk> .
or if you know , no <unk> bitter , <unk> , it <unk> their their boss , or your wife , or her husband , <unk> , they will laugh <unk> .
so , put it 's this picture , put them <unk> funny hat on , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , let them in the background horses jump , yes , they laugh , why they will laugh ?
because they <unk> imagine , because these kinds of thinking funny .
and you can be much better with the situation , suddenly we deal .
ca : man memories so delete it ?
no , i think our brain has been so far greater capacity to make it all be able to store .
it does , but nothing , because we can release them , how strong , we focus and how important to an event , a memory , an idea to rate , it comes up at us .
my appealing , you , you , they play with the images in your mind , you use the power of your <unk> , and give him every day <unk> , enrich your life .
yes , the good afternoon .
thanks for the invitation .
if i 'm on a party , i 'm going to what i like in my spare time doing and tell me to come together with friends , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , if i look shining eyes and in the head of my audience , and the <unk> of dancing crowds , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> come up .
if i then <unk> that it , where a film festival by a film festival , classical radio transmitter , sweep of the those dancing crowds , images from ancient people , in the moment , long <unk> in <unk> i’m going to sit and very focused on the art , listen .
frank zappa once said , about music to talk is so how about architecture to dance .
and something like these acts , that 's also with what we do .
so they still a glimpse to get , which i 'll talk , i put them a short film , brought .
a film .
<unk> oyster <unk> <unk> <unk> computing .
that 's my view , the right on the point .
since <unk> grow in the <unk> from the <unk> fed out , something completely different one caveat .


and we are the commanded that 's called the crisis the classical music , not at the content , so on the music , but it on their <unk> lies .
so we think the question , how do a <unk> create the music , the near that are friends and these forces holding back there , the way that we so much of you 'd like .

we put the parameter that they go out of the classic concert will know , space , time , light , the context , basically in the question .
we take for example , the relationship between the auditorium and musicians .
normally , there 's between the stage and the auditorium a gulf .
we try to the time undoing .
so here you a picture of our <unk> .
the musicians to sit in the audience , drink beer , entertain , in the <unk> with the auditorium to stand up to play a , two pieces , putting yourself back in the audience .
all this is in the course of the evening , a little <unk> .
everybody , fed it <unk> , depends on the stage and goes back .
or that 's sitting in the concert .
in classical , concert and it 's so that you 're going on the more or less of comfortable , permanent , chairs , like you here , that’s seated and go ahead to look , and listening .
but there 's music , because you ca n't actually sit still .
and we really have done , how can this practice .
if you 're sitting , and to a <unk> piece of music <unk> can , then hear them automatically feel differently .
more coming to the concert does n't a stage , i had to <unk> four stages of the audience the trappings .
the audience could , yes <unk> .
so i was the the night every once in the front row .
so important for us is that we 're not only just any <unk> do , but that we of the music from thinking .
that we so questions that spaces and the atmospheres of a vague , but also in the minds of the human needs the music that it 's like this effect can see how they affect what ?
and so that we then concerts night around <unk> o'clock in solid hours in <unk> , the s 's actually just by <unk> drains us to be in clubs , on <unk> , in the old <unk> .
but not just the spaces trappings and the illumination can listen to a living city will go and currently , but also the connection with other arts .
and so we are totally happy that we 've been a few years , <unk> work together , with us the dances , or movement to music to <unk> develop relationships that actually not dance . been written .
and so that we then <unk> for <unk> of beethoven , or for <unk> by steve the realm .
and in this year we 've got one , yes , that if you want to <unk> complete .
we first started to a concert , along with a <unk> implemented .
we have the story from the soldiers of <unk> <unk> with actors , dancers , <unk> and just <unk> to a <unk> chosen .
that has all , that as well work , because we have a big <unk> had , in this piece on aid levels .
we have a <unk> lot of people across all of germany would be harvested , so that we <unk> seen .
there is this film festival something that came from a community , it arises .
we 're totally happy in front of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> a home for pancreatic cancer .
the city is just like this big that we 're going and spaces and exciting place for concerts by finding , but also , so small that we skills .
if the beginning of the year in the spring , two weeks of the spaceship <unk> all of europe in the city are , then drops on just to the city , more people with <unk> walking , usually .
all this film festival is volunteering that organized .
we makers , are an interesting mix of students and students , professionals , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really cracked nut in total of mixed up .
and to a <unk> a <unk> <unk> that the <unk> or a coordination , and funding in your eye you keep , <unk> , seven to 10 , and makers in a <unk> , for a year for a compulsory tasks are picking .
that he said , volunteering , but you care , for a year 's why , for example that <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> into permanent hands are and to the film festival by organizing them .
we do that all in our programs and live in all of germany and distributed .
that most of the work comes <unk> and on a <unk> .
just three times , we make us about this year and distributed to an extended weekend , <unk> , they repeat the one or problems that popped up there are , and care for this is also interpersonal force output spaces , that just are hugely important is , if you do something like in motion to keep .
for the film festival , even come then 20 to 30 volunteers and/or the first responders , that for a few days or a few weeks of their hands to bring , and there to touch , where food aid 's needed to the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and clearly in these fourteen days from the musicians to .
now you could say , so you have everything else you for such a film festival in need .
but our <unk> 's still further .
we 've visited in <unk> in the city has a community around us to build a sort of us support of on what we want to make .
that comes from the classic <unk> off , this is , but also about very practical things like for example of meals , because we have a wholegrain baker , of us to bread <unk> or a <unk> , of us , fresh food to spend it turns out .
this <unk> being in a <unk> in the city where the entire year was done , and sells .
to the <unk> .
we have in <unk> a whole range of individuals figured , their living room to provide , with the musicians and samples that can .
and on this way of this film festival , something <unk> in this city has become and from the people in this city .
they relate to be a very peculiar way of with this film festival .
since the beginning of the year we could tell you <unk> support of the citizens of place a <unk> in contact , now the entire endeavor in a <unk> and a credible <unk> turns out .

so we 're incredibly deeply happy about that all of europe , young musicians played music in your hand , and home at , in cities <unk> this right .
if you 're still not that really can imagine , that feels , classical music , like to experience then they come , but just over .
the next year we 're back in <unk> and we would be happy , if you , there are .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you may know , acquire skills .
you know that belongs to rediscover for learning or to the effect of learning , but i mean , to learn to have a lot more , which is also <unk> <unk> <unk> collecting and <unk> win .
you 'll experience once <unk> , a beautiful formula for the <unk> .
what i think of the art and culture , i 've learned , well , i can not a lot of course to say , because now . ar <unk> <unk> i mean , in this field .
and so i think that it may actually be , this thing <unk> titles for a different <unk> have to be , what my talk <unk> .
art is beautiful , does n't work .
they 're also a laugh .
you receive more and the laughter , though most of the phrase usually know .
why is that ?
i think that has to do with that in the word or beautiful thing <unk> , what we 're not that actually cease being able to .
art , that we say , sometimes , that 's what .
to work as we say that , galvao , that 's what .
even sometimes .
the people , like to work , that 's what to me .
but at work , i think we tend to <unk> and at the art and instead of the rich , beyond one of everyday life , where we look in moving , our experience information , our own thoughts about pensions .
and so i mean <unk> , i 'm going poetry to , in about three hours in five <unk> shared , all the headline said , with an ending up starting to make it for you very simple .
it starts with the <unk> , for the early childhood , goes on the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not all tell from my youth to do n't worry , about and then continue to the word <unk> let me afterward , why i think that for my <unk> taken .
the interaction , for the first part of my vocational about life and finally , <unk> , positive identification .
<unk> one of them is this is these pieces of <unk> sebastian 's bach , know .
<unk> that two- and <unk> .
you learn them so in the first two , three years , you 've done reasonably practices , and i still somewhat practiced .
and so with 10 , 11 , i have little bits and ground , on piano , not far from here , at the <unk> , the house .
these pieces of life of a <unk> .
there 's a melody and ground and the different voice <unk> , but it 's very differently .
the rhythm is that moment , but it 's <unk> .

and i have , and learned , two distinct melodies , sometimes , three , at the <unk> <unk> , the same time to play , any kind of it to hear that one to illustrate the other not .
this was , what i mean , i 've learned , among them .
one another experience i 've never forget and i was the worry had it to me today may also like to be .
i piano <unk> , it was more people in the room , here today , and in the middle <unk> i came out .
i did it 's forget .
i memorized it was playing .
so again , the beginning , starting and at the same spot , i did back on it .
this audience has more <unk> almost as i , because i walked in all quiet on my place , i brought my notes , put them down and started the third time the beginning .
and they wo n't know how to me <unk> 've got behind .
but that was a very tough experience .
perhaps that was also a the experiences , where i then i knew , well with the piano , although i then quickly as a <unk> had , i should perhaps not my <unk> go , because at speeches can be easier with cheating .
yes , the next the next chapter in my <unk> i mean <unk> with the inspiration and also because i want to tell stories .
when i then so <unk> was , i went to my <unk> and told him , rather than a gentleman <unk> , i 'd like a <unk> play .
and he said , oliver , that 's not .
because you have all kinds of <unk> inspector did and a lot of experience with women raised all have .
now you time ago , a <unk> young man , so , young , such a sentence .
the i obviously not forget .
and from there , i mean , more adept at .
now i was the way down and to time in a <unk> .
i practiced , and i remember on a situation , i like never thought , i 've experienced .
it was that <unk> of <unk> of chopin , and now i get to the part of work , i have an ai n't been dominated , and she was with the most beautiful spot , very broad , you had the poor do , and then went this together again , and back apart .
i can now it could n't going to play is not a piano , here , and i could it 's no longer .
i have this point two decades , 30 times a row , and ground and suddenly got them properly .
and then i did she kept playing and <unk> , i was in one of ecstasy and ground , and i know , that i suddenly on the ground quit and laughing .
i was , except me .
i had nothing to drink , nothing in fact , and the music has this with me that made .
one experience , where i 've learned , emotions , really <unk> .

where everything from the stinking running .
we had this situation , then in the <unk> <unk> in an organization .
there was then almost anything like by itself , when we the <unk> made , has the only half months taken , where you usually a half years , would need .
so , that were my experiences with the piano , with an artistic , with the confluence of work .
and now i get to my student , <unk> .
i was first , when musicians , along , but just as <unk> .
we have <unk> played , <unk> , <unk> .
i <unk> given , and i 've told me because it 's perfect next to my <unk> for the music to continue to get people can and that <unk> had .
in the choir sing , all breathe , a <unk> sing , amazing experiences that i was very , etc. , enlighten , have .
and a point , where i as <unk> in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> went am , in the <unk> and the overhead , and i put that 's why do with <unk> <unk> , this chapter , because there for me this idea came , or this , this idea came , from this combination of art , culture , i was then , <unk> also just in the <unk> entered , politics and law school a profession .
because the art of culture to enable , to my <unk> to do .
so here to work for the art , but it 's not as artists , but , otherwise would you know , not saying <unk> , rather than <unk> <unk> and continue to be done .
i was there in the theater and i 've told me <unk> , there in germany , no <unk> for <unk> , just in vienna , where i did , and from there , i sold more comfortable with this question is concerned , what we can do to art to sustain the framework for art to improve them to say a management , a good educational administration of building ?
and that was the reason that i actually , <unk> 'm in my professional lives , in towards this <unk> , and with <unk> years , i mean , then <unk> .
but before that was a different <unk> , and this phase i mean <unk> with interactions .
<unk> i came to the germans <unk> .
the german <unk> has its <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , though sometimes in my résumé , because i in <unk> was even born , whatever it says , the <unk> oliver <unk> , about peeves -- i , i have this kind of time <unk> .
but i mean , a <unk> root , because my maternal grandparents were also <unk> <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i have the carnivale experienced .
this was i 'd like something that i 'm not as being enjoyed 've , and suddenly i became involved in a different form of culture , in a <unk> , in a culture , who lived by people in this in this <unk> device of <unk> .
once the carnivale on us <unk> , were all in a very different position , in different situations .
and i 'm going to <unk> <unk> , where we’re afraid , or dysfunctionality and <unk> <unk> , my friend and colleague who was , since then we have always for the <unk> night and song made , he had guitar , i piano , somebody else has the basses and ground , for example , i could then i memorized <unk> .
we have the <unk> <unk> done , so , but obviously the lyrics of <unk> <unk> , <unk> practiced .
and this carnivale , that was really from the people out .
it was my destiny , i at the ninth november <unk> for my <unk> learned and i <unk> n't begin with the wall fell .
i woke up the next day on , i was oral exam , oh , the wall is that we like , yes .
i 've told me more quickly respond to be ready , on any questions for <unk> .
and down there was i <unk> for the cities in the <unk> .
and i 've got back , you know , interaction as social interactions of the place between two german culture .
in fact , we speak the same language , the music is there , wonderful and was a wonderful and ground , but a lot of it was <unk> , <unk> .
different than the carnivale it was not from the people got myself , but it was a lot of the top , and that i do when a big gain <unk> , here to experience as the german identity , it brings me afterward , and once again , back , starting to track the blowout , and the german <unk> then these two states <unk> .
since is germany , <unk> .
since is also the <unk> much more <unk> , places .
interaction , i then , but in front of all things here taught me and experienced , in the city school lunch .
we have of <unk> that i had actually a <unk> , you can think that time ago , when i 'm here 's starting to <unk> , stood on my <unk> <unk> for culture and spare time .
i have the more .
leisure and stood for <unk> , you did n't write <unk> for culture and <unk> .
i was actually looking at the director of <unk> .
so i have any leisure can not so much so , anyway , that was lovely thing that i do this <unk> had , but she disappeared , soon , because i then for education in charge , and so building alliances -- for education , and shape could .

many , your interactions , we could and i could create , and i experienced , and begun to what that means , when multiple people from different areas combined a target to catch .
they memorize the way that i 've become more <unk> of the art , more and the culture , what makes us , that <unk> between humans , between cultures , between community , better , in the lens , and i come but afterwards the art .
interaction were also then the <unk> the issue than us , <unk> , seven <unk> the idea was , at <unk> january <unk> , that <unk> could , the <unk> europe and the h.r .
but that last chapter that is a fifth one chapter , despite the headline of identification .
this word , yes , two primary meanings , for one , i misimpression by me with something , <unk> me so to something , and i put it , but also as verb use and say , i misimpression something that means , i know something .
and it 's always in his <unk> .
i know anything with his <unk> , so i say , i misimpression you , or the or that community .
and i misimpression by me with something , when i do <unk> and say , that belongs to me , i want to identify .
and that 's a very big action .
five decimal point three million people to try to move , <unk> cities , identify the double , to <unk> and to realize that you a community is in europe .
as big , we have it then <unk> called , but anyway , as a community of a lot of people that in a big <unk> life and yet at least a common language to talk , <unk> nations are here and this was our business incubator , the positive identification , to initiate the people and of course , too much the ride .
in the sign of <unk> the highway , many other experiences .
an experience of the <unk> did n't have that many people <unk> .
there , ham , <unk> <unk> and eat , two schools , collaborating , young girl from <unk> that <unk> , and young qatari students from a <unk> school , from <unk> <unk> , have a letter of people , young men , from <unk> to play in processing , the home , say goodbye , dear , death , the last letter writing .
and it 's been a special effect that young girl next letter from young <unk> quoted , and having the russians and then a letter from young men from germany in something <unk> german .
and there sits down , one of these young men to the piano , and played this <unk> , i so loved .
and , oh , he quoted him from a letter , and said , i 'm <unk> , he wrote him for home , as young german , he played , and i can no longer a <unk> play , because my my two fingers exactly <unk> .
and he <unk> your fingers , with a <unk> , put yourself back to the piano in a play on <unk> carl , and trying to the <unk> to play .
and it did it 's not .
it was for me as a <unk> gets me to go ahead to jump i am , i said , what we actually have learned ?
we 've learned that in the <unk> that many people together to move anything can , but in front of all things we 've learned that we <unk> years in <unk> in peace of living and culture that connects us to us , it all the head going to because we asked different languages to talk to relate to relate to us <unk> feel .
and that was for me a wonderful experience and you see , it 's the can learn not just about , something to know .
it 's the can learn more about , something to learn and <unk> won .
and if we 've gone up and invention as sovereign , <unk> , if we do n't tolerate that we take some inspiration from art and culture , our own body position to teach us , in a dialog with the artwork , if we interact and finally , of our own identity and tried to work , by we faced with art and culture a hospital , me , then we all got ,
and i hope that they still a lot <unk> and <unk> have , of which they those profit to move .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i think , we tacked on the first picture that matter .
so i have to <unk> to support my memory that 's a few slides <unk> .
there are , but no scientific slides , but it goes in my <unk> here 's why , a way to find and me with a theme of navigating , where i think that gets us the next few years to significantly to deal .
by the <unk> words , i know now finally , thank you do , what ted , i mean , and i think , in <unk> we can this talk to deliver to categorize it .
and then i 'd have heard that you 're going to talk , in english 're supposed to sort of possible , but , if you look at it , then you see , they would n't understand , what i english , trying to say , i did n't know , right , as i thought it to say , and so , what i talk , but the german , calm .
how we will die .
i need to you first of <unk> tell .
<unk> was a patient in the hospital , where i the <unk> <unk> , and i was a developmental science .
she was about , nine-tenths of years old and has always liked the may , natalie , because it 's also on her husband who reminded , the first man that in war like it was then .
and so it 's of every year for the first of may to dance , you go and has long was dancing and probably even then a <unk> <unk> too much a drink , and then is developmental science and it , here on the right-hand side you see this , the leg is broken , the <unk> .
a few years before it was also been used to topple over and i had the same way , with equal postpone , before the left leg is broken .
and i was also been there as a physician and i 've experienced , as you weeks at the intensive , was so , with the antibiotics that was treated , also been re-inhabited as it was , and have the discussion <unk> , as i was , is because that any sense ?
it makes any sense , in such ancient people like this intense an infrared pointer to use to get ?
so <unk> , to <unk> , the intensive care for weeks , it is a people ever <unk> ?
and it 's then we 're cured .
five years later i 'm going to the clinic , i see the name <unk> , and the i can be good idea , because he just so rare is , also for the time that time , and , the dance in may , again that one leg is broken .
it turns out the question , what <unk> i think it 's actually , when i talk about , like a human , decide to , what it in his directives , writes or what he also on <unk> fills you ?
and that 's a bit of the issue of the presentation .
you see here , then the <unk> of the name , how we will die .
it 's a book out of <unk> , how we 're going to a report on the <unk>
and then it was so , that globalization very ahead , went to so you ask , how it 's going to be connected to work ?
this , then , and it is in this book now , even <unk> , just said , it 's a quality assurance of coming , so the pieces , always fit together .
it 's a networking of labor successes , it will also the job even a lot more being sent to be , for example , to china , this was a big issue .
and this is actually , so come to basically the work of individuals , so something to assemble , something with modern , increasingly high fat <unk> was that he 's always harder , controlled by either of the quality , he <unk> , of the accuracy .
and that , after my assessment , the people 's more confidence from their work are able , and more and part of a little <unk> were , where it was never about , well , the feet high <unk> to reach , and no longer why , through his work , too to define .
and if we this now carry on the <unk> and medical field , then there 's kind of course , like a trend .
if you on television , to hear about , doctors , nurses and also <unk> most are unemployed graduates , then there are the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , there has documented by side , what you did , so it <unk> is , so it does social contract is , and if not going to document is , says the health service 's also , that care or that medical practice price we do n't .

a great friend of me is now after the netherlands , you go , because he said this , i wanted to the had a <unk> practice , who gave up , is to the netherlands , you go to the doctor for <unk> to be .
the <unk> are on these development normally given a little bits of forward and he , martin , had just experienced that more old people in commuting between the <unk> , the hospital , and go back , because the <unk> do n't know , what they should go , if the people are bad day .
then come into the hospital , will have restored to go back into the senior citizens , or <unk> , and get there are going to stamp .
and this <unk> , did indeed , i thought , if it that 's structured them in holland , there , then i want me , like to train them to something here to promote that you out of this vicious cycle of <unk> and of also <unk> <unk> of people <unk> can .
there , well , in holland has come to it appeared to notice , after he the language with trying much i studied had learned that there , the same thing happens , what the <unk> had happened .
it will also the dying , increasingly a quality assurance dates .
it 's no longer the credibility that counts , but you put even in an available to find , i want for example , not been re-inhabited as being , or not to the hospital , when i in <unk> am .
and then they do that <unk> .
in holland , it 's so , and the third day or find a conversation with the <unk> instead , and they have to then , professor , i want to the hospital or i do n't want more to the hospital , when i do something happened .
so just like the forward , i want re-inhabited , or i want to do n't been re-inhabited as you will .
this data , then at a central and there sits on this surgeon , for <unk> , has always the <unk> , and hits , then the decision on this base .
if we now , <unk> explorers , yes , like in may , natalie , and also used to topple was , and imagine ourselves that would eventually a design directives , written , i want to do n't been re-inhabited as they do , it would you that the dance in may , in may , where they then again , developmental science is , admittedly , no longer to experience .
and this raises my friend now , there in holland seat , too much <unk> , he 's deal with do .
in the last word is that <unk> today about <unk> to seventy percent of people , at home , die , but in hospitals , <unk> , and that these <unk> 's also , so you do that sense , not the ideals of habitats these are for the old people , but it 's often a tightly to fund , tightly <unk> of legs , the <unk> are often <unk> and the funding and of , this <unk> find out , after my experience , just constrained by taking place .
there 's perfect homes that 's very good address , there 's very <unk> people , there are using , but if i look at the <unk> <unk> , and we have about <unk> patients in , so , coupled with , <unk> that may emerge from <unk> to us <unk> be , then i want to me to say , it 's plenty of hard , where you cope and his inner three self-worth footprint .

this is simply not the fact , but you need 2 in salaries , in <unk> and <unk> and typically do it , just the extent .
this introduction of the assurance of the result of prices are growing the marketplace , you adjust ever want to work , but also on the individuals concerned .
and now i 'm going to how to the maybe it away that can , so what do we 're in the past , because i know , first of questions , and leaves , so simple is the situation for affected .
and i 've got to just that <unk> <unk> and the article , let me , there <unk> , because i think , a society does forever , so many structures , and legal structure , which we all the <unk> , what happens in our society .
and in <unk> article on one is just that would of people 's .
and the second set up there is , you to protect it 's top of task of all <unk> .
and what i 'll often lacking , is still a third set in there , which every one , well , the assignment should have to stay going to protect and to defend islam .
because that 's a way is , putting yourself to remove themselves from this case , i recognize that at different way , and they are supposed to me just sort <unk> and feed , and then we need that i look at least not thinking about doing , like me because even die 'm going .
because in the last word is yes , so , even if we do this subject does n't like to ask , we are some point of the point out .
hopefully much later , with 20th century or <unk> .
the equivalent of course , my career as well , to say , this wish i wish everyone , i also to worry , but eventually gets to the subject to have , and if it then maybe as far is , or even just , if you <unk> , <unk> or <unk> is , it already late in life to be late in life be to say , i 'm talking about this question now , thinking .
so if you think about , what does mean , going out , then you going on the dots are coming , in the last clustered up , which are really be the five major things in my life has been ?
there 's now a book , which is kind <unk> <unk> is .
there are the self-esteem of course , there are then the friends , i , with things i repeat , and exchange can that you know me and the me through that live along , there are the <unk> .
it 's sure that trust between humans , with whom i may also to do i 've , in <unk> or in of arena or a pastor or a <unk> or actually the other people , with that i put in the relationship stepping out .
and there are there 's a lot of factors of course , there <unk> , i believe that i 'm not all through .
but if you these three different points before , i 'll look , then you have ever spilled a whole bunch of jobs , how you in life there might <unk> have to the past its own going to protect .
and then come and yet another one thing to let 's a dictatorship suppressing the <unk> experience , i did this time , such as a text , or as well , as an example .
other people can for us these decisions and this behavior , what 's <unk> , not meet .
this is my inner conviction .
we would be one of ourselves come out .
so it 's not the question , which are because others to me to do , who gets me , feed , healthier , or , for me use , who goes up to me ?

you go and then he says , how we 're working , so this interior of these transcendent quality assurance of us from outside <unk> was , it 's a way , to say , i <unk> me about my my inner would , this mechanism to escape .
because no man can i <unk> , i put themselves , because we see , and <unk> want .
and i got there 's also do n't fit in general <unk> or the preconceptions that would say , you have now an advance directives fill and because you been so old 're going to imagine you , if you have been re-inhabited as they want to see if you on a neonatal intensive want .
these questions that i can be in the last only after a long <unk> probably <unk> aerial images .
this would of people 's an inner power squat , in me is , and the not from outside of convey to be able to the state access it can protect , as a law , not , and that i also other people <unk> can and i think it <unk> be , when i just go out themselves before faced with are <unk> 've got , so that 's also know , what i was for a person , i am .
and to those conversations to lead to take it 's spaces , and since i think , and why i put this talk so called , and here , welcoming lunch , are those spaces like this <unk> into food , that i 'm standing here two things tried to be on a picture times <unk> , rooms , where we over these issues you need to think , where a <unk> space is , so it does n't hurt this is that it may not to our theory is , but that 's a conversation . there 's happening .
so we , if we old are , plenty to say , well , such a dance in may , despite my career may very high handling all ages , that would also again , which .
i thank you very much for your attention .
beautiful good evening .
i 'm bringing two things with .
if you the first part to flat , is , you think a little <unk>
it 's still a second .
we start with infinite taxonomy of .
this is really dumb , not , can take .
what you mean ?
it 's different <unk> ?
or is an infinitely big enough ?
yes !
this is not good , if this one of doing this is , what 's looking down .
so , in fact , but i nutshell , it off , for the , you know it .
and that we do n't .
we employ us with just a single .
and i frontier that 's like a little off for a finite planet .
<unk> , <unk> , we know , infinity , as we have a to know .
and it goes to the <unk> the magnitude of vast amounts .
if we in a finite along those are , and add two <unk> , in a for example , chairs , in the other people .
we know , so imagine , now , we check into the box in the number is small , there are three : chairs and there are three people .
we can we 're checking , whether in lots of the same amount of the elements in it 's ?
they count , how would we do it ?
that means we would n't until the people <unk> , one , two , three , let 's the three , we count the chairs , see three : chairs , one , two , three , three and three three is three , and beautifully .
that you mean , yeah ?
very good .
this works in a finite wonderful that work , big numbers , although it can level-up .
but it matches .
how do you 'll arrive ?
how do you 'll check , so many people like the chairs out there are ?
i realized the chairs and people picked up and not what else .
<unk> let me !
it 's called mate .
you very well , that 's obvious , not , we 're now the ground along and already know that all !
not , that 's very nice .
so , it 's called and professionally , a <unk> and it works as well , yeah ?
you take a , putting them on a chair , from the mouse .
the next <unk> , way , the next <unk> , it 's served , different people get different musical chairs , not a chair out there 's empty and the oyster larvae are the same size , okay ?
now we go into the infinity .
how do we have two infinite amount of each other , compare that ?
we would say , the one is that big or more or smaller than the other .
we could we do it ?
we were going back to .
alright , that 's wrong , because the point is the , if you in an infinite , long as what 's start to count , i 'll just say , they do n't come to another .
<unk> , infinitely , is clear , <unk> ?
so , okay ?
madame ?
way . madame !
they had this is it 's really started .
they mate .
so , let 's time .
we estimate , we estimate is the infinite always bad , yeah ?
you know , you know , no end , yeah ?
the point is here , you cook it easy .
if i for example , <unk> suppose , natural numbers , <unk> , we <unk> need to zero in the beginning to zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we have , let 's say , a copy of this <unk> and take out of the copy of the infinite , many <unk> pay off .
be left the just numbers , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all along linear numbers are <unk> on forever , very long line in the natural numbers , but on a band , lack of the <unk> , the others are the line , and the <unk> brainstorming , okay ?
we call the a lot grams of suspiciously straight to pay , we call the other infinite amount n , the natural numbers .
what you think ?
it , g , more powerful , it 's bigger than through n , the same size or smaller ?
the same size ?
but this is very risky , yes , where a missing , the <unk> .
who 's one other estimates based on ?
smaller ?
who says , bigger ?
ah , the , yes , it does n't plan , yeah ?
that you know we can also not be , yeah ?
you know , not , where what 's missing , bigger , that 's not , <unk> ?
okay , they say , smaller ?
you 'd assume , not ?

and now , and now let me , why the oyster larvae are alike .
and how does it ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the line , ah , we take the zero from the natural lot , mate , out .
the next one of zero , plus two boys from two , after the zero from the one , and i 'll get back again . <unk> .
the four , the two , the six , the three , eight , the four , yeah ?
you can that even reverse , it 's has doubled , it 's obvious , <unk> ?
and completely clear that is , through the <unk> we make it that i do it always in the lecture that 's a <unk> <unk> .
and this one , there are just the line , brainstorming and the tape is equally long , yeah ?
we <unk> the natural diet on the line , <unk> , the <unk> 're off and the tape is still going to for .
it 's just in the infinite .
so if you any given to explain what if we have learned to have the infinity learned , yes , what does forever , i know , just finally ?
an infinite amount has a property that there 's in a finite 's not and this trait that says , is absolute <unk> , a real subset of exactly this tall .
that make them in a finite not , if you from three three people two people <unk> , then there 's only one , and previously were a 's three .
yes , so we 've infinity .
is no <unk> ?
okay .
then we have a second piece , probability .

so did here , which brought .
with this experiment , i 'm sure , it 's at least one third know , and <unk> it does anybody with that 's put it , yeah ?
so , we call the doors , b , b , c .
i 've got something hidden , i hope that they have it 's not ours .
and they should go undercover , guess .
where , you mean , i have something hidden , behind those , b , or c ?
guess , here , our <unk> , here .
they number in the c .
who has another one another idea ?
b ?
who still has an idea ?
virtuous , <unk> , b has been missing , not , usually hear the yes , never come up , <unk> ?
it 's right .
it 's no matter , so they have n't mean , the three , the ability will fall and i 'm looking for me one .
it 's really matter , yeah ?
it is yes , completely clear , because the chance to keep them , jesus ' happiness , is yes , jesus , just about one-third .
<unk> , there are three things , it 's really matter , yeah ?
now i am here , i 'm just one on .
well , i of course , where it 's .
<unk> , that , anybody here , <unk> .
so , i know , where it 's , and the hunting and appreciate that , or how do whatever you do it 's called , goes into a second round .
so i 'm not really the blink explain what i 'm basically now only <unk> .
so it 's so , we go into a second round .
now , so imagine , i <unk> me on this a , <unk> ?
so , i have a door to show up behind the n't it 's and that they do n't have said .
because , if you now , b to say , and i say , and i know , it is yes , behind you , b .
then there would be yes , not a second round .
then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , sorry , had .
but i have , that 's <unk> , in the second round and go .
so i can just a comparably ambitious , behind the it 's not just not is , but what they also do n't have said .

they must now in a to stay , then i do necessarily a , on .
i 'm now this on , what they want .
or they say , i 'm c , on .
now is the <unk> , it 's now with this knowledge likely to become ?
phew , very beautiful , b is on , now i know , it 's behind , c .
or , but , god said , thanks to b is open , massacred chief bandit is , i always wanted to a to stay , this is it .
or would you 're saying , but that 's <unk> , we have to <unk> , way that we 've just another two doors , now it 's no matter , to change , or to stay .
what you mean ?
it 's no matter .
<unk> .
why it 's no matter ?
very good .
why it 's why is it <unk> ?
yes , yes , that 's wrong .
this clunky , almost , as if we do it yesterday <unk> have to <unk> ?
but that are you , <unk> , are a new , no fun .
so , here , it 's very <unk> , yes .
that get all between , i do n't , six and , yes , i ca n't <unk> years , you may i 'll no longer be part , <unk> ?
so , it on fisa , really , everybody .
behind this door is it to a third .
and it 's always just to a third person behind a door .
they 're able to guess what you want to you have to two thirds of them in the dirt .
that would you can on two doors to guess what does n't , it is yes , at <unk> do , you know , on two dozen . come , then there are , <unk> , the zero , <unk> , it 's not know everything in real life .
but here we 've just a door .
so , here 's got competition , two thirds of it 's no , what you guess .
so this is two thirds here , but maybe it 's just behind one in order to lie !
behind the 's a 's not .
so , which is then more likely ?
no way , i really have it 's hidden .
so , which is now more likely ?
it 's better , to stay , or to change ?
now it 's easy , yeah ?
yes , of course .
so , that was going to do n't mean , <unk> ?
ha !
what we see ?
they 've got unlucky had .
why ?
so simple , as well , two thirds are not a hundred percent : the difference between the theory and practice .
i hope that it was for anybody what .
thank you .
mr. <unk> you to me , jamie oliver <unk> , here just by bad food and bad food and overweight people to cover , this depressed , yes , completely .
but i <unk> `` my best thing that later everything again the way is , these experiences .
i come , `` because of <unk> farm and i did until i was 12 signature was no mcdonald 's .
that have ever to stems , right .
yeah .
thank you for the references some today .
i 'm here in around that i grew up .
and i do n't know , mr. <unk> that as well on it came to me to be asking whether i 'm at ted conference on sea , they agree to and over a particular topic want to talk .
i have made me <unk> <unk> : the subject of trust .
yeah , motivations of it 's not bad and i <unk> me the woman <unk> at that has said , maybe it makes the one or some excerpts later , many sports .
if only i also full of cancer .
so tonight about the rain , jogging , to go to be now <unk> a tall , but i have this morning in fact , training , because i in three weeks at <unk> june , <unk> , of <unk> to oslo to want to <unk> bicycle company -- that are <unk> miles .
of increase my left for the morning when rains this training do n't <unk> .
so who have a ride want to <unk> to go tomorrow morning in los angeles , in <unk> , i lad '' they all welcome .
i got 'em degrees are already said , briefly , i <unk> ' <unk> the issue of trust .
and i got 'em just started , highlighted , with the subject <unk> .
do n't worry , the nice , little <unk> , the blind faith , come up afterwards <unk> .
i got 'em before i 'm going to think about it made , when i <unk> 'm going to describe me the right place where i <unk> ?
so , i come from <unk> village with six ] houses , many <unk> , some <unk> and in my parents to the farm where it 's apple apples , <unk> and <unk> -- and what do you out <unk> `` beer .
trust , in sports , obviously not in <unk> but at me : <unk> and beer .
why marcus : `` i the story , where i exists ?
for me is one of the very important stories that i really like right from the country , the village to come , ' and there was raised 'm with two big brothers , with the oldest one brother , the <unk> is .
and with the second half brother , the same word for it 's like me .
it means that looks like bright and dark , you can see how i just might also see , where <unk> window in space , whether it light at is , or out .
what today 's very convenient is for the <unk> .
the , or we 're both can actually see , before us anything .

of the subject of the old men , <unk> .
and again until the surface combatants are tapping into .
and what to me , but whenever it was critical , is obviously , the fact , how it written you trust and receive , for that this great confidence that <unk> that we all need to <unk> as something <unk> situation , tell me time .
and that was for my parents definitely , you how many of them , my brother and i still not even blind to know .
we were so the first , then a quite a sudden in their lives <unk> .
and then they had to the situation , sort of what do .
and , now <unk> i , it 's a shepherd 's happiness that my parents than farmers are not the whole day , and put alongside us to stand and at the hand to lead , or to say , there 's <unk> wall , there <unk> you look along and you can , then <unk> feel , where you <unk> .
a , that would be awkward been -- we 've got home so <unk> .
and b , ham , our parents of the beginning of us to have encouraged , always go to go , where either of my sighted brother is .
so , in the home alone <unk> , the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , it also look at risk .
there 's the blind brother and i 'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk> farm , pushed <unk> followers , pure .
the <unk> the <unk> i until today still .
this is with the big brothers -- who are not only good for the elbow , but also for the <unk> .
and our brothers and and my brothers and i we ham the <unk> farm , just really like everything out there are done , ma , ' room could do , particularly for example , bike .
and that has the <unk> brother , with enthusiasm , starting with three years , and then we were obviously also -- michael and i .
and have then started , with <unk> to go down , as before , many little kids , today with the wheel is that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> that can .
but we have that even starting with <unk> , eventually , no .
and then is the big question : how <unk> ma , there ?
and how to receive if you that trust , one that trust the parents that the children as well , you come back from the bicycle and descend and <unk> and other thing that trust of us that we 're not permanently , where the incentive drive .
and our solution was that we obviously a , from our parents tell us have to , the <unk> , so where there is a car , where <unk> followers , but let any <unk> that stuff , their homes -- the question that you 're not the way -- because we did , so they are .
and we had to us in between orient to us that crater , remember , but the other hand , listen .
and that you can now , in here , do n't all of testing , because you will it 's so loud , they had n't have more of .
but <unk> one evening when they let 's light switch , in their bedrooms , or in whose bedroom , and then they orient to .
you can you 'll try to just <unk> <unk> with the tongue , so , to orient and they 'll notice that 's at us humans as in the bats as well -- they become a resistance .
so how the bats , the way to <unk> will also you hear , now <unk> wall , <unk> resistance , because the sound that 's different <unk> will .
and this is for me in trust , so trust , in the movement , always very important .
but <unk> well , the high <unk> to have and the security , i got 'em <unk> chance to me , <unk> piece of helping .
and i used to orient to no big trouble and that you know , even without many accidents , the one or other , there 's obviously , .
what i 'm sorry about today , no pictures , i 've got 'em , that i really <unk> itself is , one of our <unk> as children .
which by climbing up our higher building on <unk> farm .
i got 'em up writing , the confidence that grows as well , through a <unk> diversity .
and that my `` i 've got quite literally , because i was a person to the far too much later in <unk> and in the <unk> to rely on the science is focused on 'em , i 'm about one never know , or i 've never been so this ecology as i thought it myself , i 've experienced .
'em of it 's never saw in may also gotten dramatically read .
but it 's also informs to do with that 's obviously not everybody so , experimentally to be .
and diversity is the figure out of our strengths with the of the point of knowing where i 'm going well , what i 've got talent and where i can actually my strengths in fact , too full <unk> ?
and our brother 's again , did michael and i 've always took on the roofs off the house .
so it said : okay , we ham 's a <unk> .
because you can come from somewhere <unk> window <unk> of the <unk> for example .

but the last year after that , who stays that like the bottom ?
so i do n't .
and i <unk> `` the goods , we 're very well , the generation of young women , here , not too .
and of so i 'm a stop , but increasingly with .
and then was a stop the consequence that we eventually , every three <unk> <unk> up sitting , and the dad with <unk> practitioner of <unk> <unk> <unk> and no longer i knew , what he now actually tell you do .
because of trust is sort of course , then the way , if any doubt .
i had the father so , for gracious , help to help to help , if only got about the danger , relative size it was that one of us too scared of the tip of her and in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i did n't -- somehow <unk> would be .
oyster , but never happened .
he had to then , so <unk> that it looks at it 's also then slowly <unk> , or by johannes <unk> , of us , then returned .
and that was `` i for me very great that we are opportunities that had .
but i realized , do n't worry that 's not a principal , not necessary to launch later <unk> to do .
for me were the differences in sports , in my life , increasingly important were , all , yes , interesting .

so to <unk> good <unk> i would never be able to .
that i had never the <unk> .
and i go , `` dragon until today is n't like in <unk> .
i go , `` dragon until today get out in the rain .
now , not at five degrees , like the moment .
and at <unk> rainfall -- but rather than the inside .
but i got 'em , for me like this faith in my strengths with found that i asked different sports try on 'em .
as the first for example <unk> .
and that i had a very beautiful , because there 's also the instructor that the us in <unk> had , has said : ok , we have it louder <unk> children , but they send ' us <unk> couple of the blind children .
really about it , well , because there you pack , anyway , each other at coats .
and then notice here you know , what the other people power .
and there was always like my big trust , of course , when i the competition for the place to let 's a 's hard , because then you can the other perhaps , but let 's what do , what i do n't <unk> .
so there 's just a way , and this is confidence in my fast .
that one package of a foot in the <unk> ask , i find yourself backwards , let it fall , the <unk> head to shoot and then it 's sitting behind , and the competition is over , because it 's the full score , there .
i push it 's not try it .
i did it i thought , but <unk> .
i <unk> ' , it 's going <unk> bit risky .
and that i would also now here 's not voluntary , right ?
<unk> .
shit , i <unk> ' time .
okay .
the next to me that was a sport , in school , indeed , then the <unk> and just <unk> .
my parents were home or are until today <unk> and that they 're also told as children .
but for me was always in school as jesus was really important , how can i look at least amount of `` well , the school to move to my excess energy getting rid of ?
and since i had to be a way in school <unk> to do .
and although i actually always thought : that 's all so freakin ' <unk> boring , because <unk> oyster or something for the <unk> rather , <unk> ' i .
i thought , `` i used -- <unk> ' i 'm not anymore .
i then eventually , well , i do with the <unk> .
and finding 'em , just go undercover kits , gee , again , this is the great diversity here in the sport , because you <unk> need to you need power , ai n't good health care coordination , and it <unk> extreme <unk> .
<unk> -- you may have a lot also of their work recognized ?
this is what 's also in <unk> .
you will only then quickly , if you saw in the full of trust in the own humble technology has .
if you that trust in the own power has -- so the force that you that 's also then at any circumstances , the bad weather , at yield to snow , the <unk> snow , the skiing and make you can .
and if you in my case , indeed , faith in the team has .
because when <unk> that do n't see , i 'm sure we depend <unk> <unk> .
and me is n't even something <unk> happens like today -- i have the word used -- my <unk> -- there 's , yes , only one -- has already today , my practice .
it , but nothing , we do you yet again .
<unk> i <unk> 's and you now maybe just .
do with a , one , one of them before and yet another one cared .

the <unk> <unk> yes , so , you 've got two sticks in his hand .
of why : yeah , 'em , i do n't reach more free , you can i mean , my job market <unk> take and myself the <unk> <unk> .
n't do .
so i must be different helping .
i then my <unk> out , before me running .
and the told me with the voice , the route .
so the needs just always wanting precise <unk> do .
and also that 's important for trust .
the precision of communication , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> tells me just always <unk> , if it <unk> is that tells me <unk> and <unk> at the person says , `` left at 11 , then i know it 's easy to left , so the upper part of converting the morning -- with laser pointer .
if he says : the left on top 10 bit of a to left , and if he says , right up 10 .
okay , all understand ?
then <unk> <unk> problem , because then i need again , folks , or he got me back to correct , then i know , sure , now , right , which is n't .
and for me is yes , this very large , critical , if the <unk> before me running , then i have to the really completely <unk> about it 's , negative to say .
the janitor 's positive way to say , he 's for me that tool that it enables me , just really , and then quickly to be and in <unk> even faster than others , in the competition to start .
and that i can only , if i think it 's how do , with both arms me <unk> , i <unk> , on a limb to stand and i have now actually the eyes to make -- ha ha , or she can also open to make , you know anything .
and must then just like <unk> and must then on the other one leg and the same way back to stand and having here <unk> bit of balance , but has really well , the quiet .
well with high levels of shoes .
yes , and this is for me that very important point , when i 'm at the <unk> 'm just imagine : how <unk> i do it , the guy to say , so i say a guy , because i actually just releasing males as <unk> had , i create a 's the room to say `` hey , you got me with the <unk> do , because of course , you know themselves .
the white is not so , what he was telling me .
so i get ] to him the way to communicate , just open .
and that 's like in any <unk> .
so if my needs n't know , he can tell me naturally does n't help , but there 's me just wondered , and must say : well , i need one of you the curve , maybe <unk> <unk> used <unk> .
or i need one of you like now the cycling , you just showed me as well , says , how long , `` the mountain , is , because if we the <unk> o.s , who thinks you know some time : now , it must mean by being .

and there practice , `` i then we 've also look at the pilot , as a 's the cycling , i mean , on <unk> <unk> forward , i then he says , we 're not only 20 minutes left behind us , because we may -- so we ham the recent times <unk> minutes of needed -- then we 're a 's a stop and yet another rather <unk> .
of why is that for me , really important , there 's also the exact name , accurate <unk> have them .
i listen , `` <unk> -- there 's probably another , also <unk> <unk> down ?
who provides more ?
so my best thing was time ever faster , but that was in september , and so in april , may , i was a 's frankly , never as much more quickly made it , how <unk> .
and at the <unk> the moment , <unk> .
and for me , again , it 's that exact <unk> only then as possible , when i saw my ear , open 'em .
the other just showed me , exactly explain , what he turns out for you see , and i 'm so the possibility that there , my risk that related to estimate .
and this is for me a the very important things , why i say `` trust is more training and not that <unk> <unk> .
so , jesus ' paste them as a blind , i 'm not much , frankly -- from <unk> .
because i also have the experience we had to me a <unk> right , and left is wrong <unk> had .
and then was in the competition , academically , because it 's side of the route , three meters <unk> .
and i 'm the three feet just <unk> .
of so -- again , this was -- of course <unk> accidentally .
that i know , because the <unk> have , yes , spin , have so <unk> <unk> .
and i , but it happening today , there permanently , i got people say i left and say , `` <unk> , the other side .
so i was then , right , unfortunately .
does the ground , often not as much .
but i realized , in <unk> situation with pressure , that you probably also all of the work or the campus like that if it 'll quickly go .
then is obviously , precision of times , <unk> <unk> hard challenge .

and since i must be honest , say , i am more than anyone , the n't see , relative size of the advantage , because i <unk> `` my risk in ways .
so when <unk> <unk> ' i 'm pretty much all .
the driving <unk> tree , from falling slope , down <unk> , the scene before i and i <unk> ' but obviously -- and this is yes , the key part -- i <unk> `` well the good news sites .
the which then also get to be able to the confidence that there is .
and if you know somebody has found that 's really well as a hundred percent , so <unk> , i 's just need .
and so i was mostly also the same carbon targets 'em .
because this is for me in the subject of trust me just the next , very important point .
you need the same purpose and i have evidence that 's also clear to be , which means that 's because actually , trust , go ?
because of is often <unk> faster the term , you 'll use .
i trust , or the or i put themselves .
but this very important point is yes , that 's too much upon .
that you do that you to trust a lot <unk> .
and that you might as well , because we are all with <unk> <unk> <unk> fantasy -- we want <unk> sense that really see .

that we do this -- in my case for example -- from a couple of my , weeks 'em , i am i the <unk> gone .
and there <unk> ' i just : i got me now , if you look , or the i put in the case that trust you can that i saw this mountain , up <unk> .
and how do you of then , you on the mountain , beijerinck really standing up ?
well , i was obviously the shepherd boy , moose , i got 'em , some things i 'm not <unk> , if it for example , beside me a hundred meters <unk> .
then i was the relatively <unk> .
ca <unk> be an advantage , is heights , which is no problem .
and i got 'em , kept on the wooded heights that worked , now , regardless of the <unk> i went off and to look at the 'em , i then did something <unk> <unk> or i 'm in berlin <unk> flew too , because you going to <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
this is well <unk> bit <unk> , then there we 're standing up and down the car stop , then you have n't even more see , there to know , now , do it hurt , when i <unk> .
and these things are , i always been quite interesting .
yeah , and also the <unk> to have , but to simply too to know , `` hey , i think warfare , one of the way down , i mean , so yes , focus , <unk> and can just doing so , but also got a new new experience .
and so that <unk> <unk> bit of the <unk> , because at <unk> mountain <unk> yes , so , you go every 10 hours , and flattened and it 's point you just another <unk>
you go and go and it , stones out for yourselves , more plants .
you take on <unk> <unk> with , <unk> gun -- of years ago <unk> first world war and it .
so if you <unk> <unk> see , is the <unk> about the last the <unk> .
of the phone , so that the only an exciting .
we have the <unk> up of the distance ever seen or the other room .
of so <unk> ' i mean , <unk> great confidence in the <unk> -- despite his little smiley <unk> that he 's what did .
because i thought 'em , `` well , so , as i said , <unk> ' i probably still quicker way , how to the thing , charging .
but again , it 's otherwise very <unk> , because you stop to <unk> actually now not that 's a lot of zynga has .
and really exciting is that 's and then , if you know anything to be hard .
so if you then in the height <unk> and the air thinner .
or if it , along a <unk> , then <unk> little <unk> , where it left and right <unk> .
it 's particularly beautiful and if it , even at night is , and all with <unk> <unk> , then , at the <unk> , even sometimes , now he would i 'd come with wire is taking out , so he then i was also really in the eye and in the grip .
because i as the only without <unk> there <unk> and that was him , but sometimes to be risky .
trust , we know it was created that i just said audio : well , i can course of my <unk> , my friend , the process was , a hundred percent of trust , i <unk> `` you and we have that were good <unk> .
but i practice , `` well <unk> form of security , so i 'm not permanently , focus has , because , you can imagine , if you on the mountain under constant , says <unk> stone , right , right on one , the left at 11 .
there will eventually you <unk> , and while everybody .
so for us is confidence in the case was , which we 're <unk> connection , so ham , we have a wire on your backpack attached that i had in his hand , and i 'm then behind her in which loosely <unk> wire running .
i had in the other <unk> <unk> that i also with <unk> bit of the height of stairs kits 'em .
and it 's then eventually , they 're stuck with the foot <unk> stone had stamped or did with their <unk> <unk> stone <unk> that i just as well , already knew , which is so on me , lemon , and i 'm not permanently , just focus had .
and what i 'd all the evidence that really showed , how beautiful it 's actually , you kind of course , i realized then eventually , because the peak getting near that you know that goal really so again in consistency to close to have -- just like we also the <unk> , with the <unk> .
hand , but it 's also that i wore birkenstocks 'em , that trust me to go into me 'em , the oyster . ' <unk> only there , when i 'm really <unk> make 'em , as you saw the top .
but that trust is also , there , the <unk> , like trust and just work .
when we then at night , for that the mountain <unk> are , we were in the group is often very ahead and behind us are the other seven participants had gone , and that were always be reasonably close behind us and it for everyone can pause it was someone else behind us and i 've been thinking : tell ' time , why does that because why , shush , because whatever anybody notice that it 's behind us can run ?
at night , you can also the girls not from behind you look .
this is somehow not the reason , apparently .
and then got 'em my point kits , oh yeah , ok , their faith in their skills is degrees , some pretty <unk> .
you go there at night by the dark , you about 12 p.m. , uh , then you guys , no light .
this is totally drift , if you <unk> is , the air , being thin , so actually , they drift off and now , <unk> yeah .
and then it 's but eventually , so the moment , where the jesus said , yes , gee , that was actually really practical , behind you to go , because the friend of mine has just showed me all explained , we 've always <unk> -- like that women hold do this .
have all the night of us anything about , and the other , who were right there 's also like the recognition , <unk> to know , ok , it 's now just <unk> hour , that it 's got me then told .
or i quit her what 's a different now not from the mountain was telling .
and so that to know , it 's anybody else , where it may also just lousy about <unk> about perhaps we just talked about -- there are only still <unk> hour , the sun 's going on .
these same things that even mirrors from outside can trust , again , significantly increase and can just to contribute to you look like the personal medal but also done .
and for me is confidence , then given , and it 's all , then the perfect , if you just like the personal medal and that , what 's really want , then eventually , in the idea of the right there is .
this is obviously , in the exercise with the gold , in that you look like <unk> -- i actually not too , why the athlete do -- maybe , i 'm not to the value to test , or to check , whether it 's just in lead <unk> is ?
so i <unk> ' at some medals that it 's so , in vancouver in the were six hundred grams a hard .
if all this real gold would , then <unk> i 'm not here , then i 'd be the <unk> , <unk> i .
now , or in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but again , i <unk> `` the real , why you do that , is more , you can imagine : what 'em , i actually degrees created and how i mean , skills and forces are focused on a point .
how to get 'em , i was me in my skills , but obviously in the team that we all need to matter , whether in school , in the job in which one thing that .
anyway , whether the old man , or young woman , we need for that people , even in the we ca n't trust .
and if we then that goal in the head clear before you have eyes and that 's also have achieved , then that is the best evidence that we at least in a project in our lives of trust you could .
and you put it once you can , it 's also , definitely , in other areas .
thank
a science for me , this is the title of my talks , the creation is to <unk> their vocabulary of maps .
which i was progressing , is the whole <unk> <unk> , the sciences , again as something <unk> in general population to attach .
in basically what i could be satisfied .
if i in a <unk> <unk> , there 's all <unk> only with the literature to science data subjects , the <unk> <unk> is .
even though every <unk> has a range of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , <unk> , where science of topics , <unk> issues , bury be represented .
every station has at least a <unk> , where some scientific data subjects in processing .
, it 's totally <unk> , shush , what it of magazines and <unk> for children there with scientific issues .
every program has somehow , a own plume off in <unk> , but yet , is this is a pure <unk> story .
science is one thing that the can i love to address that can i 'd read , but this is affected me , not themselves .
cool , is cool -- the only way , on csi , at <unk> bath , somewhere , there are the chemist cool , <unk> ?
on csi to as a <unk> five minutes , has anything with the reality to do , but it 's cool , <unk> ?
there , you can i can identify .
big bang <unk> , because i can get a laugh , i understand the jokes , not , but it 's great .
this is very sad .
because that 's kind of a paradox of the future we 'll just manage to start with these technological issues and themes .
but at bay area that none of yourself .

a very <unk> example : in london , you have a nice little tower being built , <unk> , the architect , let 's not so now , we build the time somehow being so <unk> .
what happens is , right now that the sunlight from up in this facade into trouble , i realized that even be provisional sketched out to focus and then , somewhere in other <unk> at some point <unk> .
this was going up by the press , there was not just a jaguar .
so sad , the heat , so <unk> that this poor <unk> , really long , long it saved , there are the <unk> melts it .
there is asking you , such an architect , has the n't actually sort of times as a little thing in physics had learned , because i mean , is yes , totally fresh , that such a glass of targets .
so , what i found , really new , is <unk> , <unk> before christ , where he apparently , with radiation , a fleet <unk> .
it 's wrong question i really , which has the more design or an architect , or where he has studied ?
now that 's a very <unk> example .

<unk> , it 's going to have a few years ago , that 's kind of the media got .
there was the train has been freaky , because <unk> changed the plants , that was at a danger .

genes that sort of what the outcome .
<unk> , oh , there are gene inside .
there were unwilling to the market are actually become like , hey , i <unk> vegetables .
no idea what that should be , yes .
so , yes , okay , dutch tomatoes , we can get a discussion .
but to the time i was in the lab , even forming a hospice and was ultimately gets absolutely frustrated , because i 've tried to these guys genes in my bacterial <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , went to home , and my `` eureka moment my neighbor , <unk> , you see , but not happy , what ?
i like : yeah , i 'm trying been there are three days , such a little gene in my bacterial membrane to transform and it 's not .
this was , what i 've tried to to explain so somehow an <unk> , genetics , i thought , yes , ranging from the good old lady , if i think of genes , talking to know you know , what she .
this was , what i said , so a particular sequence that i go into these <unk> <unk> wanted to .
but that was what the woman i noticed it .
this woman has i 'm never again , the hand , all shook up , ''
who knows , what i do you <unk> , <unk> ?
genes is what 's very bad outcome .
now that 's been doing 10 years ago , and yet , the way in awareness of evolutionary psychologists .
genes that 's anybody what the outcome .
<unk> i rather long , it all read .
it says , then over the gene and technology , face and it , but really in our language to draw synchronize .
<unk> keep in europe , was a headline .
<unk> different to be far from other grain , yes , it does not genes which contained .
another kind of headline writers , <unk> it 's the rats are used to die .
yes , that was also a beautiful headline .
that are n't mean that old and it 's also quite a matter , in which level , i <unk> ways .
anyway , whether the time , or the picture , all talk from <unk> .
luckily , it 's not yet <unk> in <unk> arrived , but i 'm afraid that takes too , no longer length .
but that simply shows , which of insecurity in the population stuff , because they just not going to the issues you engage .
nevertheless , we have in our future us with these technologies to deal .
now was just <unk> , nobody had the size of the subject , but it be about things voting and choose what the most really no clue .
and this is pretty sad .
how does actually , this information from the lab in the population ?
if we assume , this small , boy , hiring scientists are sitting in his lab , has an experiment , <unk> anything , beautiful and well , and he drops , you think , gee , there 's time , what , the interest , but the public .
then you have the undercover , the professor go .
the head , choosing , okay , very cool topic , which throws his name , put more than <unk> , that 's always important in the science , <unk> be .
good idea , i 'm still not in public , it goes on a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> think , oh , great idea , class , because we make a <unk> .
<unk> , because we have a press left with a project , a nice idea , and this is coming then sort out of ivory coast .
this is then <unk> , yes , but at who really ?
now they are the institute 's rarely go alone , usually have multiple <unk> such a shared a substrate , a shared <unk> .
and of all these are then the <unk> that really cool projects , then , are about the <unk> at the magazines for granted , at the <unk> , whether it took leibniz , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
this is the way .
from the base , it will keep filtered , in ivory up until the fact , really cool experiments , the really <unk> projects , there in these <unk> come up .
that are really dispute magazine , who are actually done well , there 's point of all there 's free , yes , but who <unk> i do ?
in basically just the , for interest .
in the <unk> we call this was always the <unk> the <unk> .
so that , anyway , for interest , the <unk> then , the newspaper , yes , beautiful and good .
beautiful design magazines , reached the target that , for interest , maybe about a hunch , where <unk> it does in these articles .
who <unk> ' i mean , but really ?
the <unk> , that it anyway , actually .
the way that was now , the otto <unk> , i call it 's , mr. <unk> <unk> , under conditions of the publications i read , i tried , it neutral perspective to balance , the <unk> i do n't really .
anyway , again , our future , we will only way to master can , if we faced with these <unk> engage .
fracking , <unk> , renewables , <unk> , that are all stories , the <unk> are , the gentleman <unk> but not really understand , and over the he got to vote , i do .
my project , my idea is so , unlike <unk> , this little , young , very motivated the scientists are out of ivory to take , really fully by its normal <unk> to separate , and it 's a course , to , a seminar how to science entirely expected to communicate .
because what usually happens to a scientist , so i have a buddy , we know where we 've been good about twenty years , he 's <unk> , it 's at a <unk> rule , did n't want to his job to ask .
when he actually the mouth <unk> and over his career telling it , he told us <unk> .
<unk> , that are scientists to tell then , which of <unk> .

chemically treated , that 's kind , oh , you do n't know , which is .
the really teach them to pass first step up , that 's nice enough . if you walk on a conference , you 're and there your people , your <unk> , on <unk> anything to tell you want , then you 'd love of <unk> tell , blinding again , say , but just add some water .
where is the problem , it really <unk> and normal to talk ?
i school , that is my idea , these young scientist , not yet , so far in the hierarchy <unk> are , even a little more malleable , are , the school i how to bury our argument .
that has for every one benefit , <unk> , as well , unsophisticated investors , they want to also know , what 's in the <unk> happens .
finally , are also , tax , that there are used , so the need to actually also the <unk> communicate .
but the these <unk> , that 's just a story .
i want them , really a jury . come and they are supposed to your project to introduce your project a jury , dominating , <unk> , honestly , worse it 's not , children .
there 's a quote , i do n't know if that 's real , of albert einstein , if you do it 's not just tell you can , you 've got it does n't really understood .
so , the scientists from the lab to take and your project really to rethink , i can do this is normal understandable to communicate ?
so storytelling , there 's already several .
<unk> are totally rogers , is everywhere , in any one of the university , common , but there too <unk> i in basically just the <unk> .
who drive , because for <unk> end of town in the university at some <unk> , puts out there a talk to <unk> <unk> off ?
these are the , it anyway , actually .
i 've got back to my <unk> .
so that are the people , anyway , for interest , `` there 's driving , there are individual talks to listen .
that 's beautiful , there are any <unk> done , all these are satisfied , all you 're happy to drive for home and this is it .
so i 'm interpreting it 's another on a second thing , to say , it wo n't know what in <unk> of the project .
those scientists are also have trained , wired , actually children ?
because many really <unk> have to the key to reduce .
because scientists , like the research , and how to their world , exploring , is the same .
so to work very extreme to scientifically .
they do something like to learn the walk .
they try to do , this work ?
<unk> , falling down , no way to do n't work , next to repetition , i change a couple of parameters , i do it again new .
children learn to be very scientific definition .
that are really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i <unk> , what happens , which factors i do have to make it works or not .
this is normal .
but that we have a <unk> .
and of so i think , really can work that only , if you keep the <unk> occurs and those scientists had permanently in the neighborhood , in the environment with the kids out of kindergarten , from the primary school , where each other experiments that make the children , on their <unk> , and , there really looking up against , because i believe that the children and the scientists are actually in basically the same language .
and then you can perhaps , maybe someday , that 's my hope to tell the kids that , at home , and then <unk> i also , mr. <unk> to the , at some of scientific data subjects were interested , because the children with him that tell .

and not just <unk> i then , mr. <unk> , but also the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately <unk> it 's another thing that the first <unk> , i 'm calling you 've got to have said , yes , no way , so , <unk> for our scientists , that 's just not subject , they are other priorities .
a scientist has to know , not able to communicate .
yes , i think i then , okay , then i call and i the next time .
but who somehow , in a department at mit , <unk> is in a company , as well , there 's going to the next break .
thank you .
i 'm crazy , is the question .
and fly you can also not every day .
the past weeks were terrible .
the weather that has a big painted by the calculation .
in front of seven , after eight years i 've been asked , if i 'm here 's take you want .
i was first ceo , almost 10 years , <unk> <unk> in munich , and in <unk> .
we 're there 's pretty close up here .
they had <unk> as a client .
and for me was that actually more , well , this is <unk> .
but what do that really ?
<unk> , this is actually a ridiculous .
i then , but i 've learned you 're fairly complicated and why i stand here today .
and yes , maybe it 's a little bit crazy , but it is , too high , emotionally .
it 's beautiful and always exciting and makes great fun .

i 'm the ceo in <unk> .
the company , there 's been a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm not managing the <unk> .
this company , there 's been 20 years .
and managing the <unk> .

the managing the <unk> here at <unk> .
<unk> .
that a picture that i 'm standing here want to show the little thing right , this is actually , such a red , such a <unk> brainstorming , or anything to do n't know , at this point is still too big .
there is the world 's just <unk> <unk> .
and them are just really well-meaning , 10 to action .
this shows you know what .
there 's about 20 thousand active population <unk> .
so that 's actually not a market .
and this is n't even a <unk> .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also , why do you that then what ?
how does it possible ?
<unk> in the sake and only 10 to action , because we up afterwards , to talk about why this is .
so very quickly the history .
<unk> has a lot of crazy <unk> <unk> of aviation is created .
very short quick .

then they were in the first world war , <unk> <unk> died actually <unk> and <unk> , been around <unk> <unk> built for <unk> .
the have to london bombarded by and so forth and so on .
and when we <unk> and eight to london got these are , and with a big <unk> there a <unk> campaign to fly , what was the english newspapers <unk> full of the headline said , this time they come up , but not to bombs , but in new peaceful intent .
so that has the story because in <unk> .
and we had a deliberate misdirection campaign .
but <unk> , the client , was not as quite pleased to because he suddenly realized that is , which there behind what apparently , which old memory in there 'd put them .
and you know that was a stop for the marketing -- a critical .
but it was in london a good dress campaign , except the weather in north end up there was many years ago , very bad and very windy .
and we 're not very much flown .
then it <unk> decades , <unk> <unk> hugo <unk> this has taken .
and has a <unk> <unk> , that then to america and delivered by the world .
that has a myth <unk> , that all the german foreign nations , basically , again something felt it , which <unk> and <unk> that airship hijacked by the world .
there was the then in new york , and receive a ticker tape .
and all the german nation is your seats , <unk> , we are again , who .
this is in all <unk> that 's salted and it 's so that tells a little bit of myths , from this device .
but actually are then to <unk> and <unk> just five , six , seven <unk> have built by and really only two really big , the <unk> <unk> and the hindenburg , the passengers requirement .
passengers , a hundred , where are around <unk> passengers , and <unk> it was the end <unk> <unk> .
it was , but a myth .
and the <unk> then was the first broadcast live <unk> crash , there , unfortunately , <unk> .
but beyond the titanic that event that time , where a one icon , a product <unk> is , and then , no longer and then in midair .
well , the other vehicles were being acknowledgment .
and <unk> , <unk> the last still exists <unk> destroyed .
that the materials that uses for <unk> , <unk> , the halls velocity .
and then i was when you do anything about <unk> years .
and then the had the <unk> zf <unk> and <unk> , who had the idea , maybe you know that back to start .
and i was recruited a <unk> , because you that 's technically a great product has evolved to come we 're going to , but the market .
yes , he 's actually a market ?
what 's actually matter ?
so .
and talk about we now .
the <unk> <unk> , that may be more quickly to explain what we ham , <unk> it 's still , <unk> , people have a lot of the sinaloa federation .
there are many companies , because of <unk> born .
there are today <unk> staff , about 20 billion of revenue .
that 's a real <unk> , high as profitable .
there 's a lot behind .
the have to describe me as well convinced , here to come .
the <unk> , is actually a completely normal power plane as any other small plane as well , but it , sorry , <unk> a gas , helium 's not evolve hydrogen , and <unk> also a <unk> with <unk> .
it 's like a whale , in the water on and under the mit , and since the <unk> do have .
the time is not there yet , that in the details to explain .
inside of what 's a <unk> like , with a structure .
there are two types of <unk> .
there 's rigid <unk> , that we are , <unk> in the case , and <unk> .
the have within , no structure and they are basically like a balloon , <unk> .
these are the most <unk> , in the world was never designed are , around <unk> , five hundred piece .
and it 's only today , i said earlier , there 's only <unk> in the sake of minus to our own sake , so huddled around , two decades .
look like , then the production of , if an envelope raised from being .
the left the structure , again .
and the shell is also <unk> .
come from the <unk> .
it happened : the <unk> the astronauts .
<unk> then there are the roots .
10th one point two million dollars , such a shell .
and it 's got <unk> be , have <unk> be and also has <unk> be , and you know , check that if you in a shot in it would or a hole that 's not going to tear it .
there are doing the <unk> again <unk> do and check , whether it 's going on the holes in control .
and the end looks a controlled airship on without the bronx like it 's there .
the <unk> is so technically a <unk> product
and that you see here at the numbers , very short time .
one point where nine percent , one point where nine percent , one point , six times four percent <unk> , that means of thousands of thousands flights in about falling , maybe <unk> out .
this is very low and very good .
this is a <unk> .
that they can see .
but there 's a different trend , we currently going to make , and the have i up here 's mapped .
we had three years ago forty-three percent <unk> , when i started in front of <unk> five , eight years ago , <unk> percent <unk> and last year <unk> percent <unk> or <unk> .
and this year in may , we were <unk> percent .
if you the eight years , eight years , at <unk> <unk> and <unk> it to derive want , then you can say at least in these eight years , of course , one of the <unk> , also clear , in these eight years , the weather , clearly changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we can because the passengers , not of mist would fly .
they want to know something .
and the <unk> or <unk> fundraising actually every year , increasing .
so a bit of imagination of that our weather , not just felt , <unk> well statistically , because we make the weather , every day , to change .
but because that 's so , this is now that well , has the e.u. , a program <unk> <unk> to do , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're an integral part of this program .
i show this morning , right from finland .
this is controlled airship that is equipped to is a flying corals become .
<unk> called the campaign .
and we do <unk> in the <unk> between the surface and <unk> feet .
that means <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> t 's flying from in italy , up to finland in a <unk> <unk> .
over many hundreds <unk> measures , and analyzed the air out how the , chemically , how they react to our things that we the bottom , do .
there , so i just declared , up there are we 're dealing with the second airship on .
a great a great assignment .
and is that if you want concrete derived from the subject of weather .
that 's so very good .
and here are again a few <unk> .
this is controlled airship on top of sweden , the last week or <unk> week .
and in finland is the way the weather , super , <unk> , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the <unk> say that they had n't yet .
i am i 've got there 's wonderful , beautiful and warm days , living .
the mosquito had actually , not so bad .
we were also in africa .


because i once asked , you know what we do it 's really ?
and what to let 's really ?
the end , we were looking for two years , ready .
the <unk> was actually , not on .
the entire <unk> came back <unk> and this project was then i finished .
and a tornado , the <unk> the mast , then the time that damaged , that he also going down to be able to .
i was , but not so bad .
we had a 's very good health insurance , and they were actually quite happy .
this was actually looking at the prototype .
and i did n't know what i do to be .
yeah , what we 're going to make a very brief <unk> out of the <unk> .
what we 're going to let 's what 's all around , it 's about complexity , it 's about questions , growth or marketing .
what today we do is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we do health maintenance of course .
we need to the <unk> always get .
<unk> called the balding guy .
there are yes , also tracking device inside , after 10 to fifteen is gone back to be replaced .
we replace taxation on the entire <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there with the clients <unk> talk about we still .
we do we have the <unk> constantly doing .
we 're a general aviation <unk> operation , of the germans <unk> and from the european governance is controlled , whatever , and constantly , with <unk> how <unk> , or how it 's an airbus .
this is also <unk> and costs money and has gone up and also going to get .
the question is : do you actually go ?
you want to keep innovating from ?
you get bigger <unk> ?

what you do it 's really ?
you go further into the market ?
you go further into the operation ?
and the course we have in my time , even try .
and since we also some <unk> suffered .
how to actually also the <unk> <unk> some <unk> has sustained and more numerous times a bust .
initially at the <unk> stood still the donation of <unk> .
the population of the german age population has it was saved with six million <unk> as a donation , as the fourth airship <unk> was and he basically , broke have been to the population of him a donation .
and it 's at the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the other companies are being , otherwise we <unk> or <unk> i today anyway , not here and also other companies would n't there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and you hear the past , in san francisco to a customer .

two projects are actually failed .
so , <unk> .
meanwhile , we <unk> won .
i 've got no image that , because we that <unk> emblem not yet to show .
but just in america is now the <unk> of the first <unk> in the get done .
we have three , `` 10,000 cds .
with <unk> we build as an object with partners , the technique again .
and this is a huge success , but at the defeated you know .
two clients are basically , to liquidate been , because it does n't go .
why did n't it ?
we know it , .
either it was the location , not the right or the passengers if we needed to go <unk> or in america , if you know , did you <unk> the last 30 forty years , the commercials have done .
the ham the people have <unk> , have this is controlled airship that , have said , <unk> , again , again . <unk> , the power plug .
there , did n't that you there <unk> can .
and it was actually doubling pair of hard in marketing is detectable over to bring them , `` hey , people call , and fly .
<unk> 's good .
the pilots to transport , to transport , embrace <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year we just <unk> done because of weather .
there 's missing , then the same time a half million .
this is , bad .
the <unk> flies <unk> trajectories , here .

and we are great hired to .
which i kept messy , needs to the mistake that you think we 're booked ahead .
you could still more flights to do .
we have such a <unk> at <unk> and we were booked ahead .
so that is actually also not quite .
we do , advertising .
this is you an art was that audi <unk> .
and an audi this has done here with the island <unk> together .
but the <unk> is a difficult to market .
and we have to even sometimes the <unk> ask : power plug it 's always adds up ?
we know , really smart enough ads , but the internet has many changes , the <unk> the launch a while , because the <unk> all of control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> that 's why you today is another 10 active <unk> in the world .
we have three here .
two active , one , packed , that <unk> , three , <unk> bought , 10 percent are active .
so are then six of 10 .
that means we 're then the market in fact , if it does one is to control .
and hope to make them back , a future to derive to do .

so <unk> 's beautiful .
do advertising , even beautiful .
only we find any customers .
<unk> to do we find great , has a technological value .
because we have a client .
this is n't actually peaked .
it 's <unk> , goes up and down .
one such as a <unk> takes years until you to receive .
and then there then again , no .
there 's too funny this effect that easy for and hard to control .
, is that the situation , <unk> , a point in the market , so actually not a market .
but we go .
it 's an icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power to do it .
they ask , just about the question : in what form we make it on ?
how much money give us in the market ?
what do what do for here ?
in what form that supposed to run by being ?
and i personally , they 've got me also asked , some personal to say , i 'm sure enough to my prehistory <unk> , where i <unk> <unk> wanted to go back against the big <unk> , also <unk> has this little <unk> dead , kicking off to , it 's also here to rescue .
i was also look at greenpeace , three years <unk> , when i of vancouver island of risks , and this entire <unk> jungle , you 've seen , got me that <unk> , that i was where did what’s possible .
and there was a <unk> about greenpeace , the money <unk> are and did n't know what they do with trying to , and almost about to effectively gone .
because they have to employ to the way to <unk> .
and i have three years that greenpeace , koreans , as <unk> and now i this in hopes , a long the future in <unk> to achieve .
zero , that right ? forty seconds , i 'm still done , thanks .
<unk>
yes , thank you .

why we are today in <unk> or have plenty of ?
how we come to <unk> ?
and so , what to do ?
what 's what it 's really ?
we start with our first thing .
the first part is perhaps a pretty depressing .
but it goes , intersect , the challenges to show .
imagine a few years , if only one that even harder was that speak to explain .
that we have a problem have today , you know that every child .
that we environmental problems .
but it 's worthwhile to have over time for quieting down , are the challenges that growth for example .
all kinds <unk> 're integrating exponential increase .
if you see it 's , in a historical , long run it looks like to <unk> for example , it 's a very short , episode in history have been to be .
now , we can not imagine that 's kind of different it goes , that <unk> kept on up .
you know the climate change , the last <unk> years .
some people say , well , historically there 's , the columbian , we go to the last <unk> years .
it is also <unk> look , <unk> ' i also true .
you can also say , who needs because the glacier ?
you can also say , the ocean is far away .
but it goes , then , if you a little bit closer together so busy to sort of the real challenge to things that 's really to avoid it 's going to do we 've just difficulties in the <unk> of health .
<unk> it turns out there days over 30 degrees .
and there 's hear it degrees ' in our cities like in vienna , or <unk> , increasingly turning on the body of bad .
it goes , but also the <unk> , particularly in asia .

it goes past , and ultimately , not going to the planet .
the planet is that <unk> , what we do , there were already too much larger environmental crisis .
and <unk> , but it 's about us to the people that fuselage , in an altered our ecosystems , very awkward will live .
it 's about loss of biodiversity .
the deserts wide .
the freshwater into being more .
this is the aral sea , where an integral part of cotton , your heritage .
and all this , where that come ?
all these terrible things , say `` cancer , the hanging in the one or another form with the global <unk> together .
so , what we all of the ground up , what we harvest .
not only that the oil and the metals out and the minerals , but also , gram of resources are in renewable , but the last year after all the extent .
and we should simply watch that we as low as possible of waste to also the last year after much waste and the emissions to produce .
so it 's why , this is in the introduction , said already been the <unk> really dramatically raised to reduce .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not just a c , o 's two , <unk> by a car on a different , but really different from living .
another way to the economies .
our technology essentially entirely new to change .
if we also again , just look back the hunters and gatherers , and there are still on the earth societies , in principle that life , come with a ton of resources in per person , and year .
in a <unk> it was then in the longest time the human history , three to five million tons .
today are it fifteen to <unk> .
so <unk> , this <unk> .
and he 's very , distributed over the earth .
it 's in north more than with us with us more than for the earth is unsustainable .
and in other parts of the world , look at africa , much less .

and the other parts of the ability to use this , but more like .

and this is there 's there 's colorful , which means , there are many resources , there , where the <unk> the world .
so if we do with this messy want , then we need to the subject to engage .
so we need to change , the ecological limits what are everywhere , the <unk> 's everywhere .
and that , here at <unk> lives have is that 's not <unk> .
that has been reprinted thousands of mahatma gandhi , were as he has said , the world has enough for everybody needs , but not for everybody greed .
and there are we , like us here on average life , much about .
so .
this was the kind <unk> part .
but i always , you the needs to understand it 's worth , too , what to change .
even if i asked afterwards , i would say , it 's worth , too much like that way to live , which is more <unk> .
but it 's kept going to speak , from the <unk> <unk> you need , but a rationale , say `` i time .
so , what happens when <unk> ?
and since we need to realize that we in our money to share the world , so much to have reached the economically , socially valued at the quality , at the standard , us on average people often not comfortable .
here 's a fairly bad mood , but there are people , and you know quite sure , people that 's not so good can deal with this story .
i 've ever stared .
<unk> and climate have the same cause .
we work too much and too heavily .
this is the one hand , we get yourself in the stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i 'm also very little bit .
and the other cause us that <unk> .
what is then a good life ?
how to this is defined ?
now here 's sort of a a scientific <unk> .
well that which first time i 've said , and what i later , i 'm is scientific method <unk> , but it there 's hear it 's drum , i can this kind first of defined ?
and there 's important , to understand the quality has always two aspects .
the quality have the aspect of the objective conditions as it comes to go , what i 'm going to eat .
i was a roof over the head ?
i was friends ?
i was a relationship , i can not alive to participate ?
but just as well , you go to me , so , you go , `` i felt herself to make it ?
i <unk> ' that sometimes the perceived to quality .
and then <unk> ' i have two words or neither of the ai n't matter .
this one is the needs .
the needs are the very fundamental dimension of our human flourishing , our own , because it 's drum to feelings .
if we our needs to satisfy can , then we 're happy .
and needs , you ca n't say , desires are unsustainable , or not sustainable .
needs of per se do n't yet to <unk> .
what are the needs ?
you can make various researchers have to quote , i 'm here 's only two sides called .
and there you course , the physical needs , but also need for safety , for social relations .
for protection , for participation , after <unk> , for creativity , to spirituality , for freedom .
this all have a bit about with money to do .
but to a lot of you just did n't actually , but the question is , how can i think that in my life to set .
and there i am at the second important term .
the strategies .
the strategy , i 'm using the available to me standing around me that needs to meet .
and there 's hear it then , intersect , that i can sort of a high <unk> or with a low <unk> do .
because i can not much money to help or some money you need .
strategies that are just my act like me in my needs <unk> .
that has to my values to do with the resources , with the possibility that i .
if i have much money , i 've told pat on `` i did my needs to try to satisfy as if i was sort of money on the bank account .
it 's going to the <unk> , this is the roof over the head , to eat , and then sort of the <unk> .
and here 's hear it , intersect , that happens with more or a little <unk> , that can sort of sustainable , or <unk> be .
and if we all the strategies that i can apply to make my needs to fix , <unk> then we talk about a lifestyle .
so .
that was sort of scientific <unk> .
and now it 's drum at what we can do now ?
how it 's how does it ?
and there 's just a couple of evidence .
obviously got that fuselage , everybody , themselves will find .
but the evidence on the individual cell type on a technological way , here is , <unk> ' i , much as i think about technology has been talking with plans , and finally , on a political leaders that .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what we do ?
so , where we want to go ?
the slides , have to speak , the danger is that we speak at more affluence and more resources , waste .
the last year after all the quality , there’s just because it also the effects of getting worse going to speak , and on us the last year after all back to beat them .
or , if we do this , as it 's in a different direction , go , with less <unk> , maybe even with less mindful consumption , but with a higher quality that are connected .
there 's one of my <unk> , maybe you know , some , <unk> of <unk> of this topic <unk> , so , a better quality , with less <unk> .
because it 's a lot about technology like i can see every single thing that here we use the computer , the orange juice , the coffee , the car , the traffic , i can reduce this building ?
and cement , i can now , indeed , i can take the house of wood to build et <unk> .
around with a much less <unk> more or the same quality to create .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> has this is increasingly , the <unk> per <unk> , and there are we go in the , which is also have ever talking about being is , because it 's very deep end up here 's the company to look .
where are actually the needs ?
those services , i can actually fix this ?
and how can i that with a lot of military <unk> do ?
and that 's not with a little bit less , but with <unk> , <unk> , nine-tenths percent less .
there 's many examples of that fuselage , can .
in vienna , i do a tower be built with two decades , <unk> .
with seven <unk> is it in <unk> already built .
that in essence of wood has persisted .
that you , maybe it in fifty years , no longer need to break down , and then in his bits and not speak to speak very much less resources which is consumed with everything else , you get out there was making the moment with the half and the goal is a fifth of <unk> , the whole lifetime of the house designed with the fifth of <unk> long .
it goes , but also a lot in our own , dart , <unk> ' i really ?

where he shows , how hard it has finally , is sort of really the found out of the kind of this treadmill tries to .
the <unk> , i want to me to speak , apart the others come after , and then i was making plans , in this in this race in .
you put themselves , sort of the standards , i was very satisfied , and then upset . ' i was the new .
most beautiful <unk> ' i the <unk> , that you know about all .
when i my department , set up some years ago we have a letter writing .
then you have to speak , wait to be able to the letter back now to write `` i ai email , it ai ought to <unk> .
to write `` i hundreds of emails .
and i should be very much further .
this is productivity , this is economic growth , we 're going back to it .
but i did n't really time it saved .
i have to me what initially , done .
but there 's good examples , slow food for instance where i really sort of the claim the quality and the claim of <unk> in the foreground , position .
and with a low <unk> more quality infrequently .
one of my favorites is <unk> .
there 's a best-selling book now you have chairs , ai average person we had in germany , in austria 's tens of things in their chores .
you can you 'll start to count .
if you have two years ago , three generations , tens of things had , having employees , the personnel .
the have us who managed dissent .
we need to touch with <unk> .
and more people come to realize , with these all options .
and we need a field guides , which helps us out , of us out <unk> that as a few things <unk> .
if only one <unk> ' i really interesting , maybe is also have this ai n't use the spacecraft 's going to <unk> ' i , as well , no , tens of things out .
the next example is use instead of america owned .
a real construction boom .
the star , <unk> , <unk> , like , you might twenty years ago , somehow , in alternative , circles , was designed .
in the meantime , use it more people , you look at <unk> thinking .
you look at <unk> thinking .
platforms , business models that easy to work , how the things that we have these beautiful <unk> here , the front of a few hundred years , built were still , you use and more about the other centuries , to use it 's about the last year after all .
that which even invested was just better to use .
this is the last year after all also a question of justice .
i showed you before , like an unequal , this is they assume that as a picture , between africa and europe and a a <unk> world .
a forensic case that all the same with these resources to be relevant to , it 's only then as possible , if we can use less .
and that means that 's not less quality , because of us , jesus , dart , too much .
but it is a big challenge of the economy , the company , these products , those services , really to provide comprehensive negotiation that we need to us a good life to do with a much less resources .
last thing that has also something with the big public policy to do <unk> after the growth , <unk> ' i was the time .
if you a little attention to the projections to read , is degrees out of the oecd , <unk> , now that <unk> every week are these projections are back to bottom <unk> .
it means , yes , a crisis that 's in the door to my view , and even after the , what we speak very much with the economists 've been talking and so busy to have , there are the numbers of austria , you find the precursor for all countries growth is going to just to bottom .
and there 's no reason for another tumor growth to have the way as i thought that from my youth , from the <unk> years , you know .
part of the pure mathematics of reasons .
one point five percent growth is today , as much of eight percent growth before fifty years .
and that eight percent is that which is now it .
that are also about there , where we might imagine fifty years were .
and large , if the pie bigger is , of course , harder . eight percent <unk> .
this one percent is still a lot , so we will be good living .
but we have to speak , brainstorming we hire me , that means that could n't even if we are zero percent growth would , <unk> that yes , the next year , just as much indeed , and consume and incomes , as in this year .
that we can be nice to invest and so we can work .
and this is why not so powerfully wrong , because you get these statistics , if you know , the show that growth on the long been a `` no longer with the quality up .
the economy grows , but the quality of stays in in <unk> countries around on this level , the we are .
and actually also create jobs are even without growth happen and the reason not so intimately locked together , like that we kept telling of <unk> and how they call them suggested to be .
that just not true , and then you also time with the economy engage .
and it comes over and more and that , too <unk> how popular format , or next week , <unk> ' i , in coming in the trend , a larger story with this subject to start , navigating it .

it 's about the last year after all , and not to not primarily about the returns to create , not primarily to grow to do what to our countries do n't even more about .
for the peru , and those countries , also for china , for india there 's the ai n't very different story .
and this is the only then we assume that 's also under <unk> , if we go to speak , to grow and we just like , on this level , on this high level , the we 're good on life and economies .
it takes a 's also politically .
it 's short-term targets .
it takes some indicators , say the economists .
it does n't just sort of the growth , but we should really carefully , and measure and ask , what about it actually work with the quality , increase the kind of us ?
is the down ?
then we 've also our politicians to measure .
of course , what 's the <unk> ?
how does it sort of them together ?
we need a basic aspect of is , the <unk> finally to tax , and not the work .
who of them , especially the entrepreneurs of them , but also the employees , you know that very good .
what they kind of control <unk> , when we 've ever even a colleague paid .
that you could be a different .
the resources are sort of reduces and therefore we are the resources , tax on and not the work .
and you have the last year after all <unk> forbid , to engage them to get to <unk> to secure , health , infrastructure , without growth .
this is , but because you have to speak a little bit hard .
that conclusion , more or less , on all levels unless you can in this way to work , will , we can be hard , we can as business with the products , service than consumers , you ask ourselves , what we actually , who do that what 's sort of good for us ?
what we need and what we may not ?
the right political choice , the framework for a hard .
a couple of evidence , i was given .
and the last year after all of course , the science <unk> percent <unk> still going into the direction , how to this growth and stimulate job ?
it , but neither did .
if you the projections look if you the development can look at the last 20 years , it 's always looking down because it 's not about .
the politics does n't and the <unk> wo n't grow and create , but this is the question how we go with the world , that we a good life of have ?

<unk> the <unk> youtube , <unk> grassroots to lake .
with heart , the brain , your hand , and the last year after all , the <unk> we will have to do .
thank you .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this city .
this town , so many stories to tell .
one of them , in front of a few hundred years earlier .
and has to do with creative problem-solving .
on this creative problem-solving , i take a moment , and the story about later .
they 're going to have to the fortress <unk> .
this is this ai <unk> , here in the middle of this city is , and lots of this city , what makes us , informing us .
a different story about earlier .
it was on a hot summer day in order to reno and , nevada .
a man will notice , at once in his shoes that 's something that it right <unk> .
to him to 's warm .
he 's europeans , he knows that 's not so with the heat .
he makes a result of he pulls the shoe of taking a knife <unk> not too long sting in the world , several times makes them out of holes in .
he pulls the shoe , there is not be a knife to be , and notice he has a new climate in shoe .
it 's the shoe , and breathe , born .
and this number , you see here is the spot in the <unk> the billionaires are at the mario <unk> today is .
a company is <unk> born , with four letters .
the one or some of you know it .
he has the original idea nike even and adidas are offered .
both have been refused .
so he says , well , <unk> , i do my own business .
<unk> it going on the stock market .
so since this day per 1,000 employees in the extent you flip of businesses in about <unk> the world .
so much for the subject of creative problem-solving .
why not something to reinvent , what else is not here ?

if you <unk> have n't know , it stands for what 's an opportunity ?
this question that 's got me , often very helpful , in tough situation .
if something that 's gone wrong is , or my collaborator <unk> me or engineering n't work or whatever .
<unk> , little fuzzy memory , <unk> .
what 's an opportunity ?
and , you get from <unk> into <unk> .
what the difference can <unk> ' i do with this example here to illustrate .
and one another example by the <unk> <unk> collected , the <unk> statements all of <unk> .
and the evidence , as imaginative people who can be if it 's about their own your insurance does .
let me a few examples here show .
that are so actually like mao , at the <unk> <unk> and that has become actually , as an ad .
i <unk> `` the awesome .
my son has the woman does n't <unk> .
he 's just <unk> , what is the woman , through the <unk> <unk> .

clearly , who 's doing is , right ?
the bush .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 'm <unk> been , and two times , almost died .
because they can give me , but at least that half <unk> cash .
the last thing i was the the crash was n't blame .
one was the young woman in <unk> .
if you 're a man , is each other statement that anymore .
if you , but a woman who are , you know about it anyway , not .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish , and i dream that what we all over half of creativity to use .
many of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and that has n't be like .
why not things have just do differently ?
same things that we do the routine become are , maybe we 've got bored , or <unk> , as opposite .
why are not just do differently , that <unk> , as a little simple <unk> .
and there 's so <unk> company , the use this .
for example <unk> , they do this <unk> from them , powered man standing , these signs , or on the wall , for example , and there is then maybe so what brainstorming .
well as a way , right ?
let 's the coffee order to stay away for <unk> .
or so what .
we have no <unk> , <unk> you .
is yes , already today <unk> , right ?
if you the phone , not anything to tap you can .
or eat them with me , otherwise , starvation , we both .
rude , creative .
something as intrusive as .
i only one of the client or bored , and swipe and i go and say , okay , that i like .
this <unk> ' i out .
a <unk> has in the <unk> the current refuge <unk> , in <unk> .
once the sport , the current news , once upon politics .
if you there are three times the <unk> was , is you <unk> .
even got the main complaint about too long <unk> at dinner .
it 's a <unk> building and this restaurant , very small , so we had the chefs take all shook hands , fully to do .
it was too snug .
the have thought , collectively , what we do ?
how we 're solving the problem ?
we ca n't really quickly to be in the kitchen .
the following idea is to form .
at any picture is a arrest <unk> <unk> set of fresh <unk> salt , pepper , and a <unk> .
so that , bored , <unk> on it to eat your <unk> ever known themselves that hits you could .
just deposited differently .
a creative idea , and maybe with the <unk> solved .
there 's a person who does represent not just a popular .
you this person is the leader in the <unk> , so the <unk> the <unk> .
and currently <unk> yes , the german trajectory .
as the second day , that takes more monday , so four days .
a company has <unk> <unk> for members of the month elected , and they ancestral may already , which .
a <unk> says , rather <unk> , we thank you .
the people come to us <unk> <unk> .
the bus are packed , it <unk> done , people to organize the carpool , because each of course , and other ways , searching , from b to b to come .
but why do n't even as the basis tend to use and creatively from his biggest disadvantage do ?
sometimes it happens , creativity also <unk> .
and it comes from a <unk> might find out , just like this company , that you may .
so we know , i knew that there are at the <unk> n't really goes well , but that they said , <unk> also have to save you need is , but something to worry .
or at <unk> in the car .
because we did n't know the different , <unk> , and all possible directions .
yes .
why does n't a piece bacon and the car starts hanging , if you <unk> deprivation ?
or at <unk> it 's also transformative options , the creative to shape .
and all that has to do it with humor , with happiness , sometimes it 's really dumb , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my <unk> son with me the office .
and sitting on this <unk> me .
so , we have multiple <unk> around the <unk> .
and then he 'll turn from left to right , it 's got joy , and i in my stinking <unk> say `` the way you , listen up , well that 's not a playground .
it to me , at me , big eyes , but the playground .
and in the moment <unk> ' i actually , it right , right ?
why is not a playground today ?
why is that , what we do , not the playground for grown-ups ?
the phone , but a lot of urgency , right ?
if we are relaxed are , if we our talents to use to do that what we like to do .
and so , outcomes , but it relaxed way .
this , idiosyncratic , is that , if a particular day , the week from then it changes , which in our brains .
it 's the first day in the week , and it 's our focus on another one day .
so one other day , we usually prefer them .
so in the weekend .
that you 're listening as well , in the media .
at <unk> is yes , there 's only one day to the weekend .
or if then the most beautiful time of the year , announced that 's going to the vacation .
what are then the rest <unk> weeks of the year ?
it 's dreadful ?
we all so awful as jobs ?
a <unk> it had a time on the cover , given to talk about this .
yeah , a monday , you can ' i and the rest of you ask yourself .
or on <unk> , on facebook , over the social media will talk about this has taken .
one of me through the <unk> , one of the <unk> in <unk> .
it 's many terminal centers and i look to me , chew on .
what have the way in the <unk> , which there 's like ?
and one day <unk> i 'm in this business with these bring to buy .
and the first sign that you see here , yes , well that 's actually quite nicely .
so , with so i love to do instead to work .
i <unk> that well , i 'm a father of five kids , but i 'm also my work anymore .
yes .
or a silence <unk> for <unk> is that <unk> sign .
why that your mindset , because the level of manifest , which is increasingly , and kept coming .
somebody has since time as an answer on this direction , posted it 's not the monday , there are your jobs .
and i wonder , even in fact , with the pink , glasses , this forward to come and say , okay , do 'official ' time a shift .
what on my job is beautiful ?
this silly , is , it the pink , glasses , is , it looks equal everything from like before .
so something nice to talk to do n't that is beautiful , it 's clearly not .
the pink , glasses , this is great for the bike .
there 's what you a wonderful , the flies off , who else in your eye ends meet them .
but to <unk> <unk> they do n't .
lead to this , if we do n't change ?
actually the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside , <unk> .
it ends , maybe into a system where we like us feel like the mouse .
the mouse up a in this cycle , and running and running and running , and eventually it 's too fast , this cycle , it hits the poor mouse and they get undesired out .
what makes the mouse , but it ?
you know you know anything else , she goes back straight into the <unk> .
and again , and again and perhaps the movie , every day <unk> that <unk> you know it may not ours , making you know , soft .
that 's beautiful <unk> here with hay , so they do , yes , initially , and it goes over and again that 's gone .
and that , as funny feeling probably has the mouse , once a concussion , yeah ?
or whatever takes about something that <unk> <unk> .
i 'm talking about the many years ago , so when i arrive was from a seminar when home .
and at was , so the street under , i felt it was completely black , before my eyes and somehow got madd '' i stop .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , which is there ?
he looked me and said , no way that 's physically , all right .
but how to look , it with the <unk> from ?
and i looked into my calendar , to test this , and saw , i worked on three weeks , and sort of me , the job .
after 20 years in the <unk> and collaborator , the first , in the early been wondering whether we at night before the end you can do .
i also thought , what is it 's what else looking for jobs ?
and i started , <unk> , again , other priorities and set , to look at the one that time with my family <unk> ' , something good for me to put yourself doing .
<unk> ' , whether it ai n't other <unk> there in my job , a new spark off .
i 've begun to the talks about this large groups that make me really joyful .
i 'll take root word for the front of advice and <unk> and also other things , but those talks by pulses , going to be allowed to experience to exchange , who prepare me really joyful .
and that was n't always the way .
i myself recognizing that we need to this <unk> stress sick of power .
and sometimes need it 's this shot of the <unk> so , <unk> of me is that up again from the hospital been released , after he 's a heart attack have had and at he starts as well , <unk> .
sooner than i said , a chance you to die jogging , it 's got me still <unk> , yes , you with your running and so .
now , it themselves .
so , with <unk> , beautiful slow , in real <unk> , but eventually we will also , together , jogging , go .
what happens ?
the bottom are we 're healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curve , the growing , is the conditions , because of mental health .
<unk> minus four percent in the internationally last 10 years , <unk> almost call minus fifty percent , that 's beautiful , this is shrinking .
this rise of psychiatric disorders , plus <unk> percent .
this is something , where i think , that must be like ?
why is that ?
this is just in austria , like ?
no , even in germany , it 's like .
<unk> , <unk> , this is all the healthier .
this is so here on the left-hand side to recognize .
it down psychiatric disorders of plus eight hundred percent in the last 10 years , finds a a big german <unk> out .
the number <unk> <unk> take too .
well the cost .
and it 's think , all kinds of official , what we can do with this subject ?
do to go away sometimes form , from that , involuntary <unk> , for example here .
so this is good well-intentioned .
and somebody once said , , no alcohol of it 's not a solution .
but what is then the solution ?
what is then that which us , but again , healthy the power and complete and with enjoyment which brings us ?
and that , i was the last year 's busy .
i thought , there 's something like <unk> , it 's something that actually be ?
i figure this , the job is not that which we <unk> yields and so happy to do .
there are many other things that are important , family , health think , and so forth .
but in fact is , we the most of our <unk> in the work to spend .
and if we do that they then why not that do it to us pleasure welcoming lunch and also makes other .
the <unk> <unk> ' i do you <unk> ' as the last one more appropriate way to <unk> and for <unk> to .
these little <unk> that you , hopefully then it easier to realize it .
<unk> stands for art in realization , freedom and environment .
that go out how <unk> ' i mean , talents ?
in which the surroundings do 'official ' i think that , even with whom ?
of freedom 'em , i 'm here , to do this , what i want to do ?
because it 's the level of the <unk> , of us <unk> .
more of what gets more stressed .
and what i do it ?
the execution .
that are these four areas .
and it can everyone , myself to test .
i had this for me that particular check before a few years , and i 'll take that routinely used to sing again .
can i mean , talents to use ?
in which the environment ?
and that means , sometimes i go into a coffee shop with my laptop to the seminar prepare to make a <unk> .
the freedom .
of freedom , can i think about to do this , what i could think is .
and do i do it also ?
the execution .
the last ted u .
and then there 's it keeps people to me explain why do n't that goes .
and why this at them is more difficult .
then i often quite like an answer at this point .
who wants to find ways .
who do n't , has the reasons .
and <unk> at the spot , you can choose <unk> ' i ways , upset . ' i ways to get 'em , i reasons why ?
and they 're in both right .
what do with our talent agent ?
each of you 've got his great <unk> <unk> .
that is yes , too small .
that 's filled with the same talent , with the gold , with all , with their skills .
what do it ?
<unk> to <unk> we ask this .
or if we in hospital the equator or end of life .
what i started with my talent doing ?
the way , who here 's got fed it on <unk> <unk> , can do afterwards that there are accessing it .
so , what do with our talent , is so my first question , even at me put themselves , every day .
<unk> ' i the good enough ?
and resources .
there was yet another thing with a story .
that i wanted to tell about <unk> .
and that <unk> ' i think of the spot , do .
this fortress which was the salvation of the <unk> ago when internationally five hundred years , the enemy was coming .
and the enemies , we realized that that 's a fortress , so well , which was , you do n't take it could do .
thick walls steep ways of the <unk> to the fortress , thick and doors , <unk> , numerous enhanced .
i was <unk> time .
so we thought , here , okay if we do n't <unk> , then we form a <unk> .
we let 's no longer turn out and pure .
let 's how long , `` the that there , goodness .
the <unk> thought it from long until the day came , where the supplies of consuming these were .
they were only still a <unk> the was already on the way to slaughtered out to be as the <unk> at the bishop says , the bishop give me that <unk> and give me three days .
bishop okay , <unk> , you have you <unk> , i <unk> `` you , come to take the <unk> and help us .
<unk> going to the <unk> way .
at some of looking down the enemies , how about the wall of the fortress is a <unk> will be dragged is led , from left to right and already in the early .
well , thinking , , a <unk> , which is that .
it 's <unk> .
again , is a <unk> <unk> , up on the wall of the fortress , this is he was actually black .
enemy was thinking , oh , has two more <unk> , it can grab something else would take .
at night , we can the scenario , again , this is he knows the <unk> , there on the ups and is led .
the end of the second day , after the six different <unk> have seen the bottom , they pulled into a <unk> .
because they thought that takes us too long , that we 're keeping herself , it out .
then we 've got the <unk> down to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
the one , they had and the they <unk> have .
so we are the <unk> <unk> to form .
i like this idea that all right there is , what we need , and that we have everything .
are sometimes it <unk> resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's some time .
but also , so we can actually do something .
we have no idea of the power , we have the world every day to reinvent ourselves .
and if you believe that could now a good <unk> be they then right .
in the spring from the spring .
the coming .
and we in <unk> know that disappears into the snow , because it 's warmer here 's start with the plants , from teens brown <unk> to green <unk> to be .
there are blooms eventually come from those blooms of the crop .
there are apple here 's very popular strategies that we then we harvest and eat .
there 's grain of corn we can then grind and the bread that laborious .
there any animals , that can eat .
there 's people , then the products just turn to grow food .
and it does naturally .
but when you think about that perhaps not so naturally , everything is it 's a fear and so anxious .
and obviously this is this threat , maybe just very ambiguous and also very theoretically , but just in the blooms of the connection of the flower to plant are bees fly a very , huge role .
there 's research , to show up to <unk> percent of our food , certain foods really not there were as if we do n't make bees had .
well that , it sounds like <unk> , because it as natural for us is , and we 're bees might also not that sense .
there are now while ago , a very interesting movie , <unk> , for the subject .
and i recommend you , look at it .
now , but look forward , we walk on the lord <unk> , which you 're dealing with honeybees are working , in its primary school , in <unk> the importance of bees , much power .
that he doing here at a school at <unk> and he gets us now some of his work to tell you .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
once a big thank you , mr. <unk> and all that <unk> .
that i 'm here with my project , <unk> <unk> <unk> contribute something you can think about that live in the bees .
and that still under one wing of <unk> something about a little <unk> to tell this is fun .

that do i do n't , no .

my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years of young when i 'm with an incredible wife gets married , father of five kids not yet <unk> and have different <unk> and <unk> finished and been working <unk> years in the <unk> with <unk> adolescents and adults .
i 'm a member in <unk> <unk> and in a charity <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and work now in the <unk> <unk> above of <unk> with our eldest people whose students in <unk> .
we work out in the garden , in agriculture and in beekeeping .
<unk> is yes , actually a play by <unk> <unk> and act of <unk> <unk> .
our personal flying classroom is really a peaceful , a quiet , a calm some point .
and they will also to rest .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and not free have been the ancient greeks the relationship between the honey and so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> known .
and in a wonderful verse of homer , he describes how the <unk> <unk> his <unk> to the <unk> dense , fold in order to him to spark that it again without dense information can .
but the <unk> go there 's not myself down ; they send their blue , bees and <unk> now the poet , the lips , to wax master and we crawl into your mouth , into , and out with him later , the words like the honey from the <unk> flow .
a gorgeous image .
hopefully you get to me tonight .
yes .
this flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of <unk> , this <unk> the room now my students with me , have built up for solid organs up <unk> days in a <unk> .
in <unk> schools of us in <unk> to college or in the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> to <unk> .
a <unk> to <unk> or in classrooms will we had in <unk> .

most of the window to the kids that can see during this month .
and in front of all things , with the bees , then there are the tube , and again <unk> can .
there is then the window of the slot , created .
so .
and then begin by the at me on the <unk> .
i 'm so as a <unk> and <unk> `` now from an existing <unk> two <unk> out and <unk> they 're here in these <unk> inside .
it mattered on this on this <unk> are <unk> so the bees .

and then it 's also a <unk> , up here .
there 's the honey , there .
so , if you need to let 's bad weather is , and they 're not able to fly .
so .
this is then out .
then there 's the <unk> here again with brainstorming and begins immediately the transportation depended on the for <unk> places , or at the for <unk> place in school .
and now start something wonderful .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , these bees in there , then in the class are having a sudden a crisis .
their people made no longer .
they are lonely .
you find your queen 's not .
and this is the most important task from <unk> , when he made these <unk> shorthand for that it looked at paying the queen , in ancient people out .
that is not so on these two <unk> sitting .
and they 're sad , these bees .
they 're catching on to <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , they <unk> .
you hear that .
they buzzing is almost a <unk> higher than if you normally in your <unk> with a queen <unk> .
and now starting a <unk> .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , in one night , they develop all right now the need to a new people to create , and the whole thing happened without <unk> , <unk> , without looking at conferences , telecoms , opinions and the positions .
here is the people to agree and lifeless and then in the first night is a <unk> .
because without the queen going to this came after six weeks , no longer exist .
because <unk> live only six weeks for .
so .
and the first night , pull them out of this <unk> a pen out an egg , and bring this in this <unk> inside .
and there <unk> do it ai at the queen going .
everybody , the rest of them <unk> in the high had to say , how do that go ?
yes , genetically <unk> , but that 's all genetically <unk> .
this is true .
and now start something wonderful .
this an egg , which is normally in the <unk> a <unk> would have been going into the <unk> a queen .
the egg , the first three days , the same genetic code , like the <unk> .
and then it gets fed by a <unk> <unk> .
you know this concept .
and instantly it changes , on this <unk> on <unk> ask the genetic code .
the <unk> going through the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> changed .
that we had before you have ever heard that , what we eat , this informs , which turns out of us will .
and at the queen 's really wonderful to see .
three days , egg , five days <unk> .
and that can the students all <unk> .
you see that in class .

no , that happens <unk> .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , that 's a <unk> or a <unk> decision .
and then count the students to eight days , each of my student knows , three plus five , you put a queen 's doing so <unk> days that the queen <unk> .
and the day , if that then , so we should happen , the teachers has this <unk> in the <unk> there <unk> of your nightstand to the students in the morning about five o'clock , yes .
and then he says the mother , let’s just , which is because with you ?
yes , i need to the school .
yes , why that ?
yes , we 're the queen <unk> .
yes ?
and then there are the morning to six in school .

and if you do this can experience then they stop at first thing .
this queen <unk> .
so .
even a little bit higher .
and then you get the <unk> and slice those queen going free .
the first , what these queen , it spreads its wings , and there are now , <unk> that people what they became a queen 's dragged has its , flames , you <unk> , they think of pheromones .
the people who has now , then an identity .
now are three to five days for those queen is fed up .
of the <unk> forward to receive they <unk> <unk> .
comes up behind the chartered accountant and out , from the people , because of <unk> .
and after five days going to the queen unheard of the <unk> out .
some of thinking now , yes , i 've ever seen , such a <unk> in <unk> .
jesus , <unk> .
what different .
-- that we let me .
this queen the flying now by ourselves without <unk> , without <unk> , because of <unk> out to two miles high .
they 'd ever seen in your <unk> .
in the <unk> and will go into a bucks <unk> now <unk> , of seven to 12 drones , the male terms of bees .
so around like in islam , where the man , different women have bigger clan division here is the queen , the seven to a dozen men .
and this whole thing happening in a wonderful way in midair .
the drone to come back of <unk> that the queen , and that the queen 's cumulative picture now in this bucks mating all that , what you at the seeds have to three years to lay eggs .
for the drone is it also an amazing experience .
if they finished with the other <unk> you kill them and hits the dead by the sky .
and then there 's the queen going back and starts , to lay eggs .
there are always a , two students in the class , it immediately see .
the also see immediately the queen .
yes .
and then rounded up slowly , the project in school because i 'm going to the <unk> again <unk> and the queen and the <unk> 's going to be closely in there .
and then come , i one night , prior to this <unk> .
<unk> ' that <unk> from outside , and the next morning <unk> ' i this <unk> with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and there , you see here , the queen .
yes .
it 's fresh <unk> .
and vague , most of 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then it 's this , these two <unk> are now here in a <unk> .
in a full stick , in a particular prey and now can this came up and lustily .
why are bees in school ?
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , the kids that have experienced , forget that no longer .
yes .
there is yes , not just like that in this class , then the students all the time with the bees are together , but the entire school is yes , in this class in .
and the teacher , when it 's something you know , when it 's something that , when he when he said , because a little prepared to have the can an era for the other to join .
look , bees and this ai <unk> ago <unk> years , we cave , where the people have the honey was a millimeter .
imagine a few months , you have in israel <unk> years old <unk> found in which the people then the bees thought would have .
any human culture has to bees <unk> .
or vice versa , the bees were at any culture .
in china , in india in persia , in egypt , in greece , in rome .
wherever they were doing .
the human culture , i mean , ladies and gentlemen , are passed .
he can a <unk> , a <unk> hook , he can a <unk> join .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , you know what the flowers , or the trees , the bees <unk> , what they need ?
that you out there are now whatever -- find , and now in summer in agriculture .
this out there , this is a green desert , for the bees .
yes ?
he can touch with the students in a lot of go and shimmying up flowers are bees <unk> , at <unk> you mark and look , how long have the right away from <unk> to my kids flowers ?
how long they 're on the individuals are blooms ?
and how long , they need to them back .
it ai <unk> this right .
how <unk> i a <unk> ?
yes .
you know if that 's like this is that in the <unk> the top for the top is , or this ai n't flat side up that is ?
you look carefully .
he can a math -- , a <unk> join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can with the students , even the <unk> <unk> on these <unk> find .
and then it comes to the question is , i was karl from scratch <unk> the nobel prize for any given ?
because he thought , it has to the bees that can see in the beehive .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a hive , it 's <unk> .
one 's also a bee has nothing .
and then the professor <unk> , many years in <unk> at the university in teaching has the has in <unk> <unk> that the bees , there a <unk> create the individual <unk> .
as a <unk> net of the wax into the <unk> a <unk> create , and now with <unk> hertz , their <unk> where we deliver , and the bees , the <unk> , the eye contact with their legs , with their <unk> .
you see , what these bees in school do ?

and develop an awareness for the bees .
they learn , <unk> , <unk> what the bees do .
and they get a very aware of these creatures which in basically just for us who lives .
the bees do to wax not even a half pounds per people in .
before <unk> years , the only way , candles that you create .
they accumulate on the <unk> out of the trees that <unk> .
this is a <unk> , with the <unk> them their people out .
and now you time ago , in summer , that are <unk> -- , <unk> bees in such a narrow pitch black room , at <unk> degrees .
hey , there 's the infectious diseases , without end .
no , at the bees do n't .
because they brought in this <unk> natural antibiotics .


obviously there 's a grid , before and with <unk> with a <unk> and so forth , because they did n't happen .
yes , and then i mean , ladies and gentlemen , that pollinating the <unk> do that the bees course , and we have a few apples , if the bees , not fly would or we 'd like the chinese are just the <unk> <unk> and they themselves and pollinating plants .
there 's much more the association .
you look at the <unk> , there is the meadow , is also the growing up to pastures or , where the cows graze again .
and there are flying through the bee up , puts out their nectar and <unk> this <unk> .
and now comes the cow and <unk> the <unk> and just , because they <unk> <unk> views , it can digest .
yes ?
and then <unk> you that again , and notice , ah , i <unk> <unk> , ah , i ca n't it again <unk> .
and then there 's milk .
that makes the bee .
yes ?
and not least , pours by the bee followed us that most valuable , what it on the from the nature makes .
the honey .
i want more quickly to the point to come <unk> .
my students get excited , every year , if you this <unk> build and then the part with me , in the schools and go .
that 's not going to my <unk> but once i had a student , and since i said in <unk> in college in <unk> and i said , you , <unk> ' <unk> you put themselves before .
and then he says , yes , i degrees ' <unk> <unk> .
i come from <unk> at <unk> and i 'm 20 years .
and i 've been five years in <unk> and since two years when thomas in <unk> .
and i 'm excited , grab me that i 'm no longer with the <unk> have to learn , but with the hands can learn .
<unk> , yes , with the head .

and more than half of said , oh yes , that we want to either .
my students to experiencing is an awful appreciation and the barrier between , in <unk> , normal and the <unk> people get through the bees , salvaged .
on <unk> face , and they have confidence , my students and a certain amount of pride .
how can you to the bee network ?
the question is wrong .
you would say , how can you to <unk> the <unk> ?
and there <unk> ' i , and it 's the person , the other people <unk> and it 's a new <unk> there .
and he says , so , start with .
at a little verse of <unk> of <unk> .
who like the bee would be the sun belt of the <unk> feel the way to flower will find and never the way to lose the sides of the fields in <unk> glory of how quickly he also lived , he would hardly be crying .
thank you .
hello , dear friends in the earth .
so welcome to talk from my project .
this project i was a person , and my wife .
it 's the fight for an end of the female genital mutilation .

the society against the women with still <unk> sacrifice every day .
first <unk> ' i imagine .
my name is <unk> , i come from hamburg .
there , i <unk> years of <unk> done .
you can think that i on the job is not <unk> .
i felt i do n't <unk> .
and why i was happy that i put in the subject <unk> good <unk> and exciting host <unk> could .
for example , this .
with a massive <unk> about the north atlantic ocean of africa , after brazil .

this was a ride , where i more <unk> was as <unk> , more <unk> as <unk> .
anyway , such amounts of purpose , that interest in the media to find and even a small person as i could focus your concerns the world to the language of them .

it was ruled by there 's war between eritrea , and ethiopia and we were <unk> of the killings in there .
and despite all the cruelty , we were experiencing , we experienced the other side of the infinity hospitality of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , arab hospitality .
and once it was that we busted down by and our two <unk> , you see here , with their bodies as living <unk> before us <unk> , and the insulting about saying that are my bored .
if you have the killing you must get your belt of us through it shoot .
something like i was in any other cultures , i found .
and then in the younger years before , i learned that you conceptualize islam , can reduce the terrorism .
well , christians who want to know , not be reduced on their terrorism .
for example , the <unk> .
the inquisition , the <unk> .
but rather on the real value is how to charity , social responsibility , the <unk> .
these are the values , for the , it 's worthwhile to fight .
after many years , i came back in this <unk> been , with my wife <unk> .
and since we heard it comes from this <unk> female genital mutilation .
when i then i heard that , nine-tenths of the daily victims <unk> are the rest 're christians and <unk> 'em , i thought about how can a <unk> way of islam , besides all of terror , that even <unk> in the shoes , sweep them ?
and the idea was the highest makers of islam to get the need to sin to explain .
we were looking for the contributors in german organizations that we did n't find it .
there had to then hear that now we would be yes , i 'll be completely <unk> , the muslim was n't <unk> .
you would i the throat ribbon on .
on <unk> of amnesty , and internationally , we then <unk> our own conservation organization called futaba channel .
and they were of <unk> and <unk> independent .
and now to this battle , at oxford to do we needed a picture .
it was a scarcity .
and therefore we moved <unk> and i went back in this desert to work with the hidden camera , these pictures .
the bad bloody and images , i show you do n't , but i want to the crime , drawing .
girl at age of four weeks to go to the marriage will come from their parents and related <unk> , the planet , placed you sit on the limbs , and cutting them with no local anesthesia , the clitoris and the <unk> off <unk> with a <unk> the <unk> to , using local anesthesia , with <unk> instruments , no knowledge of hygiene , and the anatomy and the <unk> to <unk> .
what you left is a membrane of the size of <unk> .
<unk> the report now a <unk> .
if they typically get , and hurting , two weeks .
inconceivable and ruins of the body and soul , <unk> their dignity .
that the beginning was the so-called <unk> <unk> .
in the <unk> you go on .
the man has to open it .
he did n't even a <unk> woman has seen .
the uncle , he said , oh , ibrahim , but that 's no problem .
you <unk> your penis , <unk> , and then to bump you break through .
and if you get it 's not tame , is also not bad .
then <unk> you that knife and <unk> them up .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and dies a third of the girls .
that you had three months ago congolese war .
in shock , the girl puts his language .
these are the <unk> , even some in asia .
the most people are the non-muslim governed .
and whenever we are muslims were asking , why you have that 's done ?
i was the <unk> answer that we need to do , this is in the koran .
nothing is in the koran of it 's quite the opposite .
each of believing <unk> times per day in prayer , how is unheard <unk> , the creator , is , perfect , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to believe , what you there praying .
they <unk> <unk> , a <unk> to be the women 's someone has created and why , well as <unk> human being so prepotent could do , women <unk> .
but now we had the images of first key contributors , was this <unk> .
he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
there was hard and discussions , for two days .
but we had the minister in our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and the great decision , the practice is against all rights , against the religion , we need to ban them .
as recently that has the way <unk> this new <unk> signed .
and you put africa and the <unk> if you know , you know , just that has to these are valid .
and it was being celebrated , and these successes is what we actually , in other countries .
quick example , <unk> there <unk> us the highest spiritual , the <unk> of his message that it is a crime , on <unk> to write and that now in the <unk> to wear .
for weeks , we were traveling , with your <unk> .
a hundred <unk> we came out .
and where we came , we 've just open your ears , open arms and the historical sayings , saints hospitality , living .
and when we did this country will drift off -- they said the big scholar and <unk> <unk> , will you 're really all <unk> countries operate ?
so much lifetime will <unk> you do n't give .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> and because you have to get to it .
and so , he had an idea .
he said , if you like it succeeds , the ten <unk> muslims at the world of a table to launch and the explain the need to sin , then it 's a sin .
<unk> and i went to the cairo , in the <unk> and -- the mosque , comparable to the vatican , the <unk> .
and the <unk> for <unk> quite the <unk> , his <unk> professor of doc , ali <unk> we got one <unk> .
he listened to the idea of was thrilled , particularly , when we took him <unk> that we finance this would .

and then he said , i 'm the conference is not just <unk> , like us , it being asked had , but i 'm the <unk> take .
and that he did .
over cairo <unk> point in <unk> our government transparent .
international <unk> to ban on the <unk> of female parts of our bodies by female circumcision .
under the <unk> of <unk> professor of doc , ali <unk> .
and all they 're coming .
a hundred <unk> , but the highest in the world .
in the <unk> of qatar , the man has <unk> in hamburg , and the rest of europe , he 's the second largest emitter of <unk> because of the caricatures .
so men who live and death can decide .
but it 's also the other .
the left the <unk> <unk> , right , the <unk> , my <unk> .
the highest in the world .
about where i <unk> me , vacuum , and <unk> personally .
and then i did you all that greets you .
it started the conference .
and under our sign at <unk> from left <unk> from egypt .
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> egypt , <unk> of my wife , mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much for the topic that islam is not <unk> .

and then , having <unk> your film shows , <unk> .
reality .
the men had wet eyes .
they moved to go back behind closeted kind of doors to just two hours , you had decided , and a <unk> wrote , a <unk> .
the <unk> kick in front of the cameras , announced , what you 've chosen .
and the critical key sentence inside , it was this .
female genital mutilation , is a <unk> crime is against the highest values of islam <unk> .
he <unk> the <unk> .
we thought , the job is done had , but the account without our celibacy on .
because the shame , over the abdomen , the woman to talk , is stronger remained as any mind .
why we 've <unk> .
we have that we have the conference , documented in whats called the golden book .

and because ali <unk> , the <unk> , it so well , i found that book , he 's a <unk> blessed .
it gets us from the hands of rent .
we were in many countries had to conferences , right to the time , that highest <unk> .

unfortunately , but we have the most not the courage attached to that now , to announce that .
over the abdomen , the wife gets you 're not in the mosque to talk .
just some have the courage upset .
they 're at least in the universities , you go , on <unk> .

and then it goes out of speakers in the <unk> .
and that are very well , the situations .
the will it spread .
but i am running out of time .
there are all dripping on the hot rocks , and why i 'm building lot of them strategies , this topic , <unk> .
the practice <unk> .
but my <unk> this would have this .
i want to the great message the highest <unk> the world to announce the birthplace of islam actually here on the kaaba , in mecca .
of not so <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
if there 's four million people together , men and women <unk> islamic currents .
then <unk> ' i do with all the ones and the convinces king of my transparent , there , between the minarets <unk> .
how i this one ever had trained 've found in the <unk> .
unfortunately , lacking in me , the last <unk> , that was <unk> king .
but i 'm sure , when he said of <unk> it would join .
for one of these women are helping .
for others to the time to show , which the real value of islam , are , instead , and begin to demonstrate to cancer .
from terrorists than <unk> .
if i think that 's not infrequently and then <unk> ' i might this , which in hamburg , launching it had .

and we transparent , there <unk> could .
and maybe <unk> i do it 's another thing that little girl puts his daughters , <unk> needs .
then , my life that 's worth it .
and i appeal of every one that this idea now , or seen has to join .
well , not join this has been a <unk> .
we have the practice in the ton of hunger strike , otherwise , stepping i 'm here from this stage , not yet 100,000 .
and now i want to conclude with the first draft of my <unk> ever been showing .
this is my <unk> , my <unk> .

down there , we put it , in german .
female genital mutilation the koran , and the ethic of islam is incompatible .
it 's <unk> and one of discrimination of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'll start , got to look at .
so we saw the <unk> out that you as a refugee camps in germany would get .
at <unk> attention <unk> have my mother , my brother and i first so one package <unk> .

my mom was completely terrified , because they did not understand why the us now <unk> food production capability .
the third day we have finally get resolved .
we stood on the trash , they chose this stuff back to throw it was a <unk> wife and <unk> that easy to <unk> out .
they tried to us to explain , hey , that you can eat .
this is not <unk> .
that tastes and actually a very good .
it 's the cheese .
my mom took the eyebrows up and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my homeland , although <unk> but the did n't like <unk> smell .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
in fifteen years , i came to my mother and my brother of china to germany fled .
this kind of escape <unk> ' i 'm telling .
but , it made me to be able to the people would be used to escape , gives you have and to a success did .
but first marcus : `` i 'm going to where i 'm sure exists .
i 'm <unk> .
<unk> are a little <unk> in the northwest of china life .
and this region is from the chinese that autonomous area <unk> called .
it 's about <unk> kilometers from germany away .
in china to live in general -- 10 million <unk> but in munich , is the biggest <unk> community grow outside of china .
and this <unk> life , so here because we in china under constant <unk> suffering badly need .
hundreds of chinese were extra for <unk> relocated , so we in our own home to a minority are becoming aware .
our own native language , <unk> turned out of education eliminated .
in schools and in university will only still in chinese were taught .
and our religion can we also not free to act .
the <unk> lose it into their culture and identity .
and if , courageous , is , and for the right the <unk> pursuit of losing your long-range sentences , torture , or even die .
this was also the reason that my parents , for you 've decided to us kids to escape .
this was <unk> and i was 11 years old .
this picture is just before we run to form .
we did n't enough money , so my father had first time to leave .
i <unk> ' at me , many people , at the run have helped .
i <unk> ' at me , many paintings .
i <unk> ' me , but first of <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
i 'm chairman says it just before me , when i my eyes <unk> .
he was big had this ai <unk> , whatever , and we met him , with their little lada on a parking lot .
the first rate has to vomit .
i know that many of a negative image of <unk> have to the only do business plan to refugees , above , not for the fates to care .
but i would edit , `` tell me to edit , grab him as <unk> call , not as <unk> .
because <unk> that has <unk> phobia .
he stood on the airport in <unk> on a <unk> and has to the last thing <unk> , if we also really sure of the <unk> came .
airport in <unk> we came on , and i know , as my mother got to me , she goes straight out into the airport .
beside you 're not to .
until we are out .
because i was happening in my hand a pass , and there was also my photo in here , but there was an alien name , <unk> .
i had as <unk> through the <unk> .
and i <unk> ' at me <unk> <unk> the me <unk> he had my passport in his hand .
silence .
and sweat .
a long lens .
we were testing <unk> .
in munich , came <unk> ' i look at a lot of the first responders , somehow , supported by man .
i <unk> ' at me the <unk> woman , with us in <unk> used by .
in a <unk> with four <unk> per <unk> ages of families .
at least the spaceship , children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
there alien faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to us a <unk> parts .
there was really melting down to sleep , and done homework .
friends were not going to visit , because i <unk> , where we four-year-old kid .
just my <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> knew anything .
they knew my story and <unk> me , and they took care , to me .
for example , she brought me to <unk> <unk> what i now , i do .
but it helped me , somehow , german <unk> meet .
i spent all my adolescence in <unk> .
this was for my mother 's not easy .
alone with our children with her husband and increasingly in the uncertainty , because we know , just a <unk> and they could make any <unk> be .
i <unk> ' i remember that i 'm very , aggressively , was to the time .
it 's me also slightly embarrassing , this now here 's all to tell , but now i must be easy to my story .
i was extremely aggressive and that showed me in school at some way to focus .
the 1980s brought us first to the catholic <unk> where we first time to normal child in touch were coming .
with a normal , my `` i children , not in a <unk> dwellings we needed .
i <unk> ' i was also on the <unk> the me and my brother . to <unk> or <unk> sent to have .
just so we can kind <unk> .
i <unk> ' i was also on several <unk> <unk> the little bit of homework done , because our parents did n't a german , could .
or the have to us just drawn .
we 've always very happy .
i know , how we always before the fence line standing and waited until these people came , because , took the foreign people for us time , and that was that was important .
after two years , finally got my father to germany .
the problem was , but that it directly from <unk> to <unk> <unk> was because it in munich , apparently , no way more for him , there .
i <unk> ' at me the very , engaged lawyer improving the it has managed to my father before the <unk> to china to protect us they made it even notice that it we had in munich a living , having me .
i <unk> ' at me this period where i really , very , happy i was , because after six years <unk> allowed to do we finally in a standard apartment across .
and we got a <unk> for three years , and we had finally , a own apartment , with your own the bathroom , and one of your kitchen .
and i even had a room .
it was that 's very small and i did n't have desk in , but it was fine , i could my door <unk> .
and i <unk> ' me that i the time , very well , which i 've , but i had yet the <unk> without a round off .
i went to me to do n't perspective .
there was a <unk> to me in <unk> always been supported , and it 's still going on the idea that i know about the second <unk> my degrees <unk> can .
first <unk> then the <unk> .
i thanks to the teacher , the fact , i thought , and i was really not just to the time i made me it 's actually going to the middle <unk> .
and then i came to <unk> .
and before i 'm going to <unk> came , i played this engagement with my best friend <unk> at <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project of organized <unk> .
but i was no good <unk> that hit 'em , i also only done because we went through <unk> a place had , where we simply could go .
we had a valve matter , what we <unk> <unk> seen .
and the director of <unk> helped us kind of that we our problems with him tell you could and he <unk> us and i could look at all wondering what kind <unk> .
and then i came to <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project , where young people without a lifetime of the possibility of wars , the artistic <unk> .
that 's got me personally really well done , and i 've begun , art is something which i was also slightly <unk> .
by <unk> and the introduction to <unk> got a filmmaker , on us .
he made the movie <unk> about the lives of my friends and me .
and the film he won lots of awards .
we realized that the people , for our story was interested .
he was a very special feeling , because we do it 'll never experienced that had to people we 're listening .
and that was such a moment , where i thought , okay .
i do n't want more <unk> .
i want to college graduates from my life .
a collaborator of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees from me on the idea for a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to join me .
but since i put in the <unk> building , i get really get lost was i ended up at random at a <unk> for a play and the title is <unk> one to four .
so i was just right .
i was playing with .
and the cool thing is , after a performance of the two editors , <unk> <unk> on me <unk> .
and i had asked , if i 'm very easily have time our own <unk> to do .
i said , super , the golden ticket .
ok to do 'official ' i do with .
and i did for the <unk> <unk> , now , pulse <unk> and one of my contributions of a play <unk> , where i also known themselves <unk> was for the european <unk> placed .
and i told him , actually won .
now study i think of the school for <unk> and movie munich <unk> , the third year , and i 'm <unk> the <unk> .
and all this would have to me to do n't have been possible if not individual or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> well , i used to have .
they have to me believe they asked me spaces were open , they asked me ways , i showed how i my place in society me <unk> can .
and to come , `` i 'm going to them .
any of you have to people like me to help the second chance to get and their lives or her place in society to find .
because , the people , in every day come and internationally hundred million refugees in munich , and any of you 're full of hope and any of you have a huge potential .
they have it with great and determination , i did many terrible hurdles that have to make .
and with this determination , you could really big for profit for germany , and for each of us too .
and i could actually thousands of things to tell you what you can do , but because i had no longer enough time i 've even though there , one minute . fifty , i put them a <unk> brought .
whip them now your cell will take you ca n't tell me tell you to no code <unk> can .
we scan it the code , and then they come on the side of <unk> with many possibilities , what you specifically , can do .
and that would give us all right to help .

and then scan it the code .
i 'm chairman says it .
many have the phone , not in his hand .
you so virtuous , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> yes .

very pleased to me to contact .
my name is a robin chase .
my <unk> is going to be easier than it to speak .
i come on one of austria , that lies in vienna .
i 'm excited , grab me nonetheless , very , today in <unk> be to get , is really beautiful here .
i really pissy , i 'm here every time , very well .
and this is not the phrase , this is a sense .
yes , yes , in contrast to the other <unk> i 'm not today , here to give you about anything to <unk> .
i did n't know , which .
it 's so that i 'm sticking to write in my spare time and then some talk anas ' , mostly in <unk> <unk> or <unk> or just <unk> like the world today .
yes , and i was also today i asked , here 's a text <unk> the all this program a little <unk> .
now that to push ' i 'm doing here .
yes .
i start with a joke .
meeting , two million chickens .
this tells a so , are two english , chickens end up <unk> youtube , and <unk> so not <unk> , but <unk> ever been very funny . i <unk> youtube , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
this tells the other , yeah .

here we would have this level of targets .
the first text is a little <unk> , that i just written on 'em .
i got 'em , it was a person 's devoted to me , partly , which means .
it carries the title <unk> .
and yes , they did it was going on themselves will not understand .
when your head in my lap , was sleeping under your rest of my ceiling .
my leg , was also under my ceiling , your leg , was outside the ceiling .
my leg , was for the ceiling .
it 's about your head is hold on my lap <unk> , the rest of her camping under the ceiling , my leg as well under the ceiling , her leg out of the ceiling .
that has <unk> , as if only my leg is extremely long .
it was very romantic .
the next text , i also then a person 's devoted to me very much means .
and that my grandpa owned .
we 've since no contact with more .
my <unk> grandfather was from career has a butcher paper .
now as a kid , it with love <unk> cut .
me about it just like , yes .

better be the n't .
jesus is the only big savior is standing on this sticker there at the glass of the bus .
but where jesus was when he made me before he wanted to sticker <unk> `` save should be ?
there to think , yeah ?
i mean <unk> already taken ?
anytime text .
the next text is a little bit more .
he takes actually a half hours .
so to write .
and read it faster .
is beginning of a novel , i degrees in the <unk> write .
ah , it 's about <unk> guys , so the adventure , from a guy , again , the hair <unk> and a little too much <unk> .
i <unk> ' me , but over here , we pay off of i distance .
because i would edit ' i 'm never the hair dyed .
chapter one .
if i <unk> is my head empty .
as abandoned like the sheet , that he has been going to fill it .
yes , i 'm not come .
very hard half hours .
the next text is also a little <unk> .
most people do n't .
i do 'official ' i plunged ourselves too hard .
and that 's the really , i play , `` love with my vocabulary ; and with my language .
i got 'em have always likes to me playing .
and yes , then you get hold these things out .
it carries the title <unk> .
is a little bit strange yet <unk> .
is actually undermining the <unk> <unk> , that i 've ever had written up .

yes , we 're frozen foods .

we <unk> .

but i can do .

i budweiser can not .
yes , i did it felt herself also have n't .
no idea .
yeah , to clap of me out .
i say , ' time , either , or no .
the next sheet , has also do with text to do .
is something like a little <unk> .
i got 'em , that time for the insects and writing .
very polite .

is a little <unk> .
and that as if only a 's cool , if i think that makes you to three say <unk> .
my writing is wearing the title , all good things are really cool .
<unk> <unk> oyster <unk> so dry .
<unk> step <unk> <unk> .
so we have you stroke , <unk> , <unk> and scratch and then becomes the better and yes , that is it .



alright , so that what the wind power to stop .
the text that holds the title <unk> and goes , here .
yes .
this is fun with you .
the <unk> text is just one sentence .
i write `` so i love to little <unk> .
this is a <unk> sexual pun .
sexual feature is to <unk> s 's written .
<unk> s ?
yeah , .
this is fun with you .

the is in <unk> written .
is a very long sentence .
i think it 's almost impossible , <unk> in <unk> to explain this is the point .
here , text .
this day is a <unk> .
is the title of the text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows it .
he 's already known to me before it as such <unk> 've .
he got me <unk> whose quick woken up , then he would me <unk> .
i could do to me later , in him <unk> .
i told him the joy .
it as <unk> front of all other days <unk> and me back to sleep a ringing .
with a <unk> <unk> on the face where else ?
and purpose , it 's no longer to be celebrating , by i <unk> .
and i was later , but again , wake is it does n't make a crappy day seven lanes have .
there hope , right ?
now it 's time for a joke .
what i said , and albert einstein , when he would be a steak medium does n't taste ?
i of a q .
so .
the letter q and sounds like the cow .
it 's why this funny .
yes , the next text which has also the papers already memorized it 's learning .
this is more what political .
so , i write `` it’s not just fun things .
i write `` well as part , very political things .
and that the pat one i often wondered , where i <unk> .
and , yes , we got 'em , i saw these text is written .
he carries the title <unk> .
my dad came from vienna , in my mom and i 'm from her .
yes .
we would have this <unk> .
thanks for the noise .
yes , here , edit ' i 'd like a little do advertising .
i ca n't cards , or so afford , so i have this was always <unk> do .
and that <unk> ' i also known themselves , events and i <unk> also became a <unk> <unk> in vienna .
fourth-graders love , dropping .
and yes , i <unk> ' , i <unk> ' voices actually very <unk> .
and , yes .
that you want , `` i just have said .
it goes on the program .
more advertising .
this is a little plug , i just written up .
feet .
the realm of vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin a toe .
you have ever been very funny .
i want to grab a joke about the <unk> your girlfriend , say , but the punch it was just plain stupid .
yes , is not degrees of my <unk> .
<unk> youtube , <unk> grassroots to stop the <unk> <unk> <unk> youtube , <unk> race <unk> the <unk> <unk> of computing .
yes .
thanks for listening .
you staying great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
they let me to contend with a <unk> question is beginning .
why do you <unk> at all operate ?
i mean , everybody , the tax money , consumes one would wonder , if he <unk> some potentially of society , which give you can .
the answer is clearly .
we know now that the life expectancy for a moment in the birth , just to about <unk> percent of genetically <unk> is .
it 's got any kind of environmental impacts , <unk> give the impact on <unk> have .
why we still so little ?
why are we were bombarded by <unk> messages from the <unk> , a part of each other -- disagree with ?
you remember , all going to fifteen years , it seemed the guilty found .
it was fat .
you thought , if you fat from the food eradicated , we 're all got sleek , and be healthy the old .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves , with different <unk> in america in supermarkets , has led and what do n't touch it has changed the americans every year 's thicker become aware .
then you have said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
there are some carbs .
now what to <unk> like the <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> and so on has led .
so it takes over this ai n't new <unk> hurdle , it village <unk> .
where the whole <unk> ?

typical one example of a <unk> alisa 's here .
the <unk> you know about all .
<unk> published a lot <unk> there’s a new <unk> .
the top <unk> the <unk> <unk> for the <unk> year .
keith richards , i was seven years on top placed .
then passed away from the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest one person , the evidence , depending on the earth has lived .
<unk> years old gone .
i know , there are some people to say , they are six hundred , you can , but at their <unk> n't find .
jean <unk> is actually <unk> gone .
and they listened to <unk> up to smoke started , but with <unk> , then to end up with <unk> <unk> the process of virtue to follow , and stop to smoke .
with <unk> is solved it died .
what that tell us ?
no , cigarettes , healthy .
but it tells us , aging , very complicated is , and that we eradicated statistics , we need to an experimental media systems and we have basic questions .

what is that ?
we know it 's now .
that 's on testosterone up <unk> so , which in the male <unk> produced by .
and there <unk> quite common evidence for <unk> men are just as old women .
you can now everybody for yourself think if that 's a <unk> <unk> is .
austria 's a redistribute country .
but it 's getting better yet , tips , not afraid .
general , should we hats correlation was with this causality , causation .
sounds complicated , but it 's on calculus <unk> to illustrate .
there has gone , so sure ai <unk> grandma , and ask , what they have , because so different set up or not eaten them to that old become are ?
ah .
the granny say , every day of tens of cigarettes <unk> .
this is probably the secret of their ages , right ?
and have the tens of cigarettes , maybe just not <unk> .
or , but they have <unk> and the granny say that would be without the tens of cigarettes , even get older .
and ourselves hard stats , are not always <unk> .
there for example , ai n't very hard stats that shows that people , the <unk> in the <unk> go to get older than people that 's not do .
<unk> .
it would reproduceably put them .
this is at the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's because that the people just enough money in his pocket have to the good to her age , and the <unk> diseases to take care .
if i but a group of <unk> a <unk> to forage and give them and this group with 20 percent live longer than this ai <unk> the <unk> just did n't got , but otherwise very same given was then i actually probably a <unk> factor in the food being affected .
and actually are these attempts taken .
must tell you , the <unk> is very bitterly divided the mainstream , but even i do with my enemies , agree , this is that <unk> <unk> life this spread .
and this works for the media installations , organisms .
for example , bacteria .
you see with this ai <unk> of bacteria .
if we the <unk> , in the <unk> line showing you live in the significantly longer .
the same for <unk> , <unk> flying over mice and recently was before about two years in america has shown that 's even for the monkey recognized .
and it 's not , skinny .
it works , <unk> the blazes kitchen .
and that 's one another experiment , which in the united states has been done .
what did you did here ?
they have it ai <unk> taken and has one of this so-called <unk> administered to a <unk> diet , where you so many <unk> this day and night he got .
and who to wonder about it , the mice are being dick became , sick and have this ai n't very invidious <unk> had and bad <unk> .
now , you ai parallel <unk> taken and that has the same with the same amount of <unk> fed up just that <unk> ai n't break .
the have the daytime , not much food plan , they do have at night , twice as much eating .
and this <unk> now is a sleek , and healthy and they also has no <unk> .
although it onto animals <unk> feeding were .
both have equal as much eating .
the a sick and the other healthy .
so what happens in fact ?
it 's a process called cellular <unk> or <unk> turned it .
whenever they were organisms , or stem cells replicating food taken away then starting from the organism , redundant constituents in the cell or injured , uncuttable constituents crumble so to turn again , energy to do .
that makes sense .
and that looks like .

the <unk> then with the stomach and the compounds are <unk> and the cell as energy back to spend a question .
it will actually the damages on the age , accumulate in the limit given .
certainly is the molecular <unk> the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> often tell us .
so to use it , there’s <unk> <unk> they spread that live in different organisms .
and it 's likely to assume that , who works .
and we learn from that it 's not like in <unk> recommended , every little <unk> day with two decades , <unk> fighting to do .
no .
but , they 're supposed to say , if you 're hungry , ah , maybe going on the <unk> turned it .
welcome you your hunger , as a boyfriend .
and that 's also <unk> sense .
while <unk> decimal point where nine nine percent of human history has the person , what did , when he famine had ?
alright , he 's dyson 's gone .
we go out regularly look at the fridge , hunting , if we 're hungry .
and that 's safe to the biology .
now we know , and this is already in the bible , in <unk> chapter <unk> verse <unk> , the mind is child soldiers , but the meat is weak .
the garden , looking for us to the way out .

the three <unk> here 's okay , the food , all day , to use it serve .
and that 's sort of the actual <unk> .
we went to find the to represent ever done , the molecular response of <unk> <unk> though the organism to eat .
that would be able to be interesting to their <unk> not enough evidence that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it could we might have a the hardest <unk> of life to preserve .
the question is so we can the <unk> , the <unk> , the cellular <unk> <unk> , although you eat ?
and we have a hundred , at the thousands substances scans , natural substances .
we did in a found that means <unk> .
<unk> is a solid substance , in all of organisms has become monogamous slugs embody the but also in all these organisms out over the <unk> less will .
in your skin is it at <unk> .
<unk> people have significantly less <unk> in your skin as <unk> .
and if we now <unk> on human cells to build for example , then you see here .
this is this ai humane cell division here .

<unk> cells were very precisely look like .
and this works in different organisms .
this instance , shown on a <unk> .
so we ai substance , i figured out of the molecular <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
life , because the organisms do n't even more .
and the answer is again , you see with this ai typical <unk> of a <unk> .
there are simple <unk> .
after <unk> days are all dead , after the spaceship days is about half the dead .
whenever we <unk> into water to be here in very colorful characters are the animals grow and surviving better .
we know , human cells that we of <unk> ex vivo <unk> have in culture , about three times as long to survive , if we 're going to <unk> shoes .
and the latest research , we put too close that even the lives of all over mice , <unk> they spread it .
and it 's not only the life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are significantly <unk> .
so .
now you want of course , all know , where does <unk> ago ?
how the name is already says , it 's the sperm being discovered was , you get it in very high concentrations .
but i can you <unk> , even in <unk> fresh green and pepper mushrooms , cheese , and a product of <unk> <unk> , which in japan , big <unk> afforded , that 's <unk> <unk> 's very much <unk> ago .

they have to see , you know that the common denominator of all <unk> diseases is that during the ages , <unk> in the brain <unk> .
and we did in experiments that made about .
they wonder , we have the on fruit flies .
flies by which is also a forgetful memory , if you old .
they have more <unk> in the brain , if you old .
and the molecular mechanisms to the memory in charge these are very much like the people .
now you ask you anyway , how to the devil has the fellow and the memory of flies to measure ?
this is the experiment , what we share with stephen , these seals from the university berlin , you did .
you take a hundred flies and lock that 's a picture , which is a dancing flames , they love .
<unk> .
and let the , in this <unk> <unk> .
then they pick the same fly to give them in the next chamber , and give you <unk> other , flames , they love , which <unk> .
and we make it the <unk> enjoy , but they ai <unk> <unk> .
the classic <unk> .
then they pick up the same fly to do the here in .
the driving this degree in the elevator , down , there you that .
and if you have here get there are going to give you off the one hand <unk> and of other side <unk> to .
where you go into the all going ?
yeah .
to <unk> .
except the wonderful here .
these are the <unk> .
or , we say , they have a character .
i love my <unk> and i let ' i 'm not by this ai <unk> reward <unk> .
okay .
is , but this ai n't form of the character , to the age increases .
not only in fruit flies .
and we could actually the <unk> the fly through <unk> on a <unk> , on a <unk> , equivalent to bring .
and the <unk> in the brain had created , were back the velocity .
that means <unk> does n't just against the balding , but also to <unk> diseases , and prim .
and that 's important , because we want you know the <unk> not the lifespan per se extend .
it is no point , the time the <unk> to extend .
and i want you do n't be released , without them again a few practical , tips to do we might have a younger women stay .
again <unk> <unk> .
it 's not about that you weigh it boils down the like .
there are actually now in austria , ai n't set of <unk> people , the one day to eat and one day , do n't eat .

and the thing that very favorably by .
that it 's <unk> .
and avoid it <unk> .
it 's not about carbs , complex , carbs , streaming at not too dangerous to be .
it 's really about taking candy .
you know now , <unk> sufficient are just to get diabetes <unk> , even then if you 've got sleek .
and you know , sugar the growth of tumors -- accelerate that .
here it ai <unk> , the purse , we look at ages .
after 30 days are all dead .
very low doses of glucose reach out .
to a <unk> effect to create .
there 's just an example that works in almost all of organisms that .
food they routinely out-performing the fruits and vegetables .
and avoid them the gift of too much <unk> or from <unk> ever .
you know now that <unk> -- and <unk> cancer might induce can .
this is not under conditions for them vitamin d .
we are there might have degrees ' in winter , a <unk> , because vitamin d being driven by sunlight on the skin is building .
some , you least three times per week , ai half hour , sports , this is completely trivial .
and cigarettes , despite the bet <unk> examples of money they <unk> 10 to fifteen years of our lifetimes .
do you in times of the eternal <unk> occasionally the rest of .
the impact of praying , and blood pressure on the life expectancy is really notice .
because the monks in almost as long , `` how women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> to live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> are still more than <unk> .
just <unk> die , sooner than <unk> .
what is that ?
the people assume that 's what with addition to represent to do .
no way , no way that 's very simple .

and what kind of that probably in your <unk> .
<unk> scaling , <unk> and so what to be of alcohol , under conditions there <unk> .
so , alcohol , ai <unk> effect .
a permanent partner , or this ai family , longevity is associated with .

now imagine you 'll <unk> .
this , but with <unk> nothing to do .
it 's about <unk> .

and that again , if he says , i was , jesus , get used .
i can already fine to sleep and the noise , i do n't get out .
not true .
he 's still more <unk> in the blood and that 's bad .
exposure to <unk> be because <unk> course .
we know now , <unk> very good is metabolic effects .
so , it that the <unk> down .
and we also know that onions and <unk> mice , you 're infectious to protect .
knew that way our grandmothers , kind of us with <unk> and so on <unk> have .
certainly not without purpose .
several long-term studies of evidence that dark chocolate , dementia <unk> effect can .
and just recently is a beautiful paper <unk> that has shown that this ai for half the board of dark chocolate day at the <unk> of <unk> on this level of <unk> can be .
the like a database entrepreneur you of coffee there 's the <unk> but it thinner .
there are trials , that show , there is studies that 's not show .
what 's clear , this is that coffee , diabetes <unk> works , and their metabolic performance better .

ai n't very nice and intricate study in a hundred thousand people to fifteen years of the study were have shown that people that every day , ai handful of nuts to eat their <unk> about 20 percent down .
this is a tremendous economic value for this ai <unk> study .
and this is for almonds , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not to peanuts all the <unk> seen in fact , beans .
the give just saying , they smashed call , okay ?
that are , but actually , beans .
so for the peanuts and so is not .

and avoid them the recording of too much more animal protein , so of meat and dairy , , if you between <unk> and <unk> years old .
ai n't very beautiful new research shows that you , if you in this <unk> too much , animal protein to take you <unk> so much higher , as if you a strong smokers , be .
this is not for the time afterwards , where the animal protein , which are good and it 's true of course not , faster-growing children or teenage years , the animal protein that we need and it 's not for pregnant and people like that 's going to .
general , and avoid it <unk> .

all <unk> heard in the pathology labs .
this is the gentleman <unk> <unk> the has about after that regime that lived and he 's <unk> years old gone .
it comes from my home <unk> from the <unk> , is never get sick and become .
and it 's hear it very good .
he 's just did n't <unk> alisa 's not an anecdote , but he lives in a <unk> , where it 's a lot of healthy <unk> there .
it 's about the <unk> followed that i do you today , i 've said .
we should look at all the <unk> experiments , ai n't important fact , however , not passed .
which is that <unk> of <unk> me , collectively being a biological or not a <unk> seems to be , and so after a <unk> .
you <unk> the old people less , and that could one of the <unk> wrong with our culture .
<unk> wrote the great novel at the <unk> a year ago , he died .
the brothers <unk> .
a piece , the the contemporary of critics , the adolescent , fresh <unk> .
i thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question that i do you spot .
a question , where now you would strictly have , because that 's a little <unk> , who of them is very lonely ?
the <unk> 's very low .
less , even when i thought .
it , but probably the reasons why do you 're not reported that have also the people that , which is plenty <unk> would .
many people confuse <unk> and loneliness and think that would <unk> .
what 's not at the case .
you 'll see , and loneliness is actually quite a phenomenon of people than just to be .
maybe there is it also about that they 're not reported that have , because the question of fuzzy pedagogy .
you feel that , lonely , or is you very lonely ?
you can lonely , feel pressure , lonely .
and you can be lonely be , in the moment lonely , to feel .
and loneliness to have too much to shame , to do .
well that 's some now here <unk> have , and loneliness to <unk> .
and loneliness to lead into the shame and the shame upon in loneliness .
and loneliness to take time .
that as well , is , here , none of reported that have in a few seconds , which i do you 've given .
and loneliness to take <unk> .
and loneliness to take the time to , their observations ever occurred to be .
and loneliness is also requires an exercise to talk about being able to .
and this exercise we actually have whole lot not .
we have neither the language , we sign for ourselves to see when we are lonely process ?
there , and loneliness to two <unk> , which , i 'm running into am .
the one part of humanity , says , you is from beginning of lonely .
of the birth to death is you just really lonely .
there 's a few moments in life where you that <unk> can .
these people go then we tend to <unk> and steer the whole day .
i got 'em . no time , is so you <unk> .
and then there are people might be less <unk> to say , everything is with everything connected .
that i think there are not actually , so , i is just a piece of big universe .
and there 's the great group , to the i also am the time , so , just so imagine .
the thinking , okay , today i am feeling lonely and the next day , oh , it goes , all together .
if we of loneliness to think falls , we always begin with the very large and loneliness to an overall .
the loneliness of <unk> , and loneliness to the sick on an icu .
but about this <unk> , about these large <unk> <unk> ' i 'm going to do n't talk , but i want to talk about the small , the everyday <unk> , where it’s loneliness that we also in such a theater , globaloney can .
i 'd also not talking about the burden , and <unk> of <unk> .
and loneliness , to detect disease , we usually did n't mean , and loneliness to us to establish <unk> already .
the photographer and christine , tailors , in the break a few photos taken that i show you want .
how easy it that keeps falling , , and loneliness to discover .
and we 're not , whether these people , really that moment , lonely felt .
but who knows it 's not , the moment in such <unk> event , where you think , all talking together , you yourself is something lost in the corner and has anybody to <unk> .
this sudden <unk> loneliness to know , safe here all .
may have some of you today , i 've seen .
what you about it does , you put that cell phone out very often , well that could you today , you see is that <unk> , that <unk> on the mobile also an escape , <unk> .
clearly , visible , if you on the display , we look .
what we now this is n't do .
yes , and then there 's the loneliness to the degrees of them face of loneliness is one <unk> on <unk> stage , hundreds of <unk> faces in front and you even something out in hopes that you get its own writing is not forget .
these are the <unk> that the outside it looks .
that we other people we ascribe them .
but i 'm sure , there 's also people in the room , from birth of lonely , feeling of your life , so <unk> have to make you have tried , and loneliness of the <unk> to distract them .
and there in this room , guaranteed , people who are feeling lonely , because it on a different people get rid of have it if you because of death or because of a breakup .
there 's using it 's nothing to have so many people , even people , with whom they are connected , around you are you feel very lonely .
and there are people that have the relation to yourself lost to find any given more to , and are so , one lonely .
i <unk> ' that the digital loneliness .
and sit in `` you 'll the analog teaching and loneliness .
the analog teaching and loneliness is we 're familiar .
that are people who after their opinion , it <unk> of social contacts .
it 's always be relatively .
there are not the official number , no <unk> number , when someone that grow human to lead , when i do n't .
we fall out there was instantly for the old people .
it 's the analog form of loneliness .
since we but everybody in cities in housing fused together with very many people at facebook or using twitter or facebook is this digital loneliness and bigger and become .
you can do with hundreds of people to be connected , with a single human right now linked to be .
it 's at the analog loneliness is likely to the quantity of human relationships , the missing is it at the digital and loneliness to the quality of relationships .
the two forms of loneliness to be very much against <unk> .
that 's also about the analog teaching and loneliness to a little <unk> poke around .
whereas the digital loneliness to be good place for <unk> and columns in <unk> .
it is that matched to the digital loneliness to the future , you gain is when the opportunity , to connect to be bigger .
i do n't know , if you in 20 years that feeling that the our from loneliness is very similar to be that , more loneliness to call it .
or whether you do then a new concepts that are occurring .
but that are also kind of problems in the <unk> generation .
almost more than the loneliness to itself is the fear in front of loneliness and from this fear in front of loneliness that are people say to do n't ready .
<unk> , the big <unk> , as a <unk> person has a wonderful <unk> written <unk> .
in the details , what people do everything to do n't alone .
they build cathedrals , you witness of children , then they are feeling lonely and alone .
but that <unk> did n't they named the fear in front of loneliness to distribute , which is to spend money .
<unk> go .
things owner .
both the process and legal , the loneliness to because it anyway -- short term , a touch it creates , the objects themselves , you are acquired by .
only problem is that 's very quickly going to help and holds that those potions for the power of loneliness .
so we need again and new things to buy us to <unk> .
i got 'em just the advertising for a a <unk> panties label seen .
and the <unk> 's very , <unk> of phone to communicate with the slogan <unk> evasion of computing .
what that in my panties , to do , you know you do n't , but apparently it goes this .
and loneliness to have so nothing to the <unk> to do loneliness to find out of people like taking place .
<unk> <unk> has a wonderful poem written , and there is a verse , but the worst is the loneliness to <unk> .
hand on it 's heart , who knows that 's not ?
in a relationship to be waking up or the or the other at <unk> to monitor and , suddenly , terrible thing only to feel , and horrible lonely , to feel and the question to ask , who is this guy really ?
'em my wire to do something to do ?
a study of saying that to the <unk> women around the fifty , married , with kids , feel .
evidence that 's missing , because i now , do n't know , if i the study to you 've invented so often 'em , they told .
but is now , no matter because it at least in studies , mostly care is , and the response time equal is that people before me <unk> .
that intuitive way to be completely obvious thing is , almost have a <unk> .
and loneliness to <unk> is anyone familiar and yet , we speak not about them .
speaking like that kind of loneliness to the sex .
well that has probably already has experienced .
even as you <unk> is , and got to think , what do 'official ' i 'm here 's what ?
who is this person in my bed , anyway ?
well this sort of loneliness that does n't exactly what to have to deal with the quality of sexual <unk> .
well , nothing to do you 've got to the quality of commitment .
it 's just always there .
we speak only do n't about them , because we do n't you look .
we speak only do n't about them in the workforce .
in the workforce is the loneliness is also <unk> than we think .
i stood <unk> on this <unk> <unk> and i 've seen a group of five <unk> , better , three people carrying the suit and two people carrying costume either .
the two men have to speak , the two women in a costume designers have to be entertained .
and the way of state something <unk> , something <unk> with the <unk> in his hand , the .
i <unk> , i have you the scene n't draw out on with you this shape of loneliness that everybody 's also have ever in the workforce actually has experienced , again <unk> can .
it 's the kind of loneliness of <unk> .
it 's but also the loneliness of <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see , there are perhaps even some of their lives <unk> of <unk> .

where they are , where you wake up .
well that 's a form of loneliness to the not talking gets .
just heard it also <unk> , and loneliness than <unk> be abused .
cue , installing insulation .
i once , a <unk> told that he 's called by a client , and the has said , it 's what 's <unk> happens , you can do n't you imagine .
a <unk> was alone in the lunchroom .
so , he himself to <unk> declassified .
and two months later , he 's also have stepped down .
the loneliness is n't alone so .
it comes increasingly in relationship with other feelings .
she has beautiful siblings and they have ugly , sibling .
the ugly siblings , we know all .
fear , sadness in desperation , anger and the shame .
but we should also the beautiful siblings , not forget .
the freedom of the proud of the desire that <unk> .
so i have an appealing to look , and loneliness .
and come to go in life like seaweed , and floods occur .
let them , and let you 're not by her drive .
because there 's something much worse than the loneliness and this is the emptiness that maybe for the loneliness to get you know if nothing more noise .
and loneliness is part of life .
since i 'm so hard of loneliness thought i 've got to me two things change .
all , in my <unk> the <unk> i no longer as a <unk> dictator , since i realized actually did that i only then over someone phoned 've why he does n't touch , because i was thinking maybe i 'm losing i the people , maybe the pat one i lonely .
i , but it 's been cast , since i think of loneliness and in my life is yours 've got people come and go to cancer .
so just about the <unk> , you look like power .
well , i 'll be free and become .
people come and go to cancer , they do n't immediately to vaccine programs , whether they have come from an encounter a friendship , or even a partnership have been able to .
as a child i found my parents an embarrassing .
that can look at any <unk> activist , with somebody a conversation begin .
if in the <unk> or in business .
every time led to make it unending world talking .
as a child i found that as i 'm embarrassed .
as young adult , i know you picked for <unk> that being able to this openness to have .
but first since i found myself , of loneliness is bothering you 've got to get it 's me anyway , and go back to me , <unk> like to open .
you see it 's very lonely be called , willing to the next artistic performance .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i got 'em up here three bleeds out .
a <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now follow up , `` i they 're just one of accessing columnist which <unk> would you take ?
the most people were going to hire the <unk> decide .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we do with the least effort into the biggest impact on outcomes .
in health , we doing this kind of different .
there to the activity with the largest negative effect disappears completely gone out of eight and make us , for some strategies .
we 're forced us for the <unk> and the stands for sports .
big <unk> but in a huge effort .
for me why not so valuable .
or we 're forced us for the <unk> .
the stands for diet .
also very <unk> but still very big effort .
for me why we also not so valuable .
and i want you today to tell you with the least effort into the biggest <unk> revenue .
if you to prevention and health , concerned , you get to an issue , not a drum from yourselves .
and the issue is overweight .
and the subject of obesity , was in germany , long time , no matter , like up in the <unk> .
and then joined the number of obese people in germany has been on .
and i asked me , which was there was going to in the <unk> ?

and then i research and i 'm also <unk> gone .
because it was just in <unk> .
what was there ?
there was <unk> to germany .
and we 're over and thicker ?
and i keep looking .
<unk> comes <unk> to germany .
and that obesity , up .
and in <unk> take the curve . right at the journey on .
and what happens then to germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how does this means .
and we 're over and thicker ?
well , then i was one , and one <unk> .
because it was yeah yeah .
sports is thick .
and of course <unk> ' i 'm not here today , to say , sports and dick 's doing .
because that 's not true .
but one , we 've now you 've seen that .
the flood of the new <unk> -- and <unk> did n't notice that led to <unk> and you’re going .
what it 's so then ?
the diet ?
and also there ai n't really good study from the united states .
and that have the problem with obesity .
and they have in the <unk> <unk> dates .
and then they wanted to shortly after watching , so what happens in fact ?
and they 've seen that people take it actually becoming increasingly less fat , but the people taking whatever , fewer calories to be -- but more serious mustache .
and that was the paradox .
and so you have it <unk> called .
we can be able to explain that ?
because you allowed to the body as a station , imagine .
because we have here it ai n't really big <unk> .
and the one side of it 's a <unk> , i do we all the <unk> put that would be here is incinerated .
and here is the energy <unk> when electricity .
if we now , but more <unk> here in , give in our power station , when we on the other hand , waste <unk> the energy in the power station , and it does <unk> .
the human body does n't matter <unk> .
the can the energy stored .
and that in terms of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
what happens , but if we have fewer such as we 've heard , energy <unk> and yet <unk> , here the energy , let 's one thing to .
the <unk> has to drastically reduced .
here you do n't live longer than it .
we 're yes , mobile .
and this is this happens .
our grandparents are <unk> yet 20 kilometers to walk you walk .
and we come today degrees ' time on one to two miles and these are the positive estimates .
there are trials , the reports of five -- until <unk> meters .
i <unk> `` you this is something else <unk> with my friend mike tell .
you giving me degrees ' the chair ?
mike , you come degrees ' time ?
mike 's an american .
he 's really shy , he will not talking too much .
and he was back at this trial and sitting now .
he 's this typical southerners <unk> , jeans <unk> <unk> and he has a <unk> in his hand .
and mike , eating more and more and takes only still <unk> , and yet it 's over and mustache .
why ?
because that mike , sitting .
and i 've ever watched , how much exercise mike , such a day , and did ask him times as a step counter the back in the bag will put them and at night i looked back <unk> .
and there was put a thousand steps .
this was so the distance that mike , driven , the morning , the kitchen to the car with the car back office there , obviously a coffee i do , and the evening again .
and he came up a thousand steps .
that means that mike 's been on the day , ten minutes on its legs .
<unk> hours and fifty minutes i was mike , or was mike .
those conditions that creates disease by itself .
and mike 's not so therefore fat , because he too much eating chips because as long it up again and energy <unk> these were n't actually uses it 's somewhat more serious mustache and the energy <unk> .
and the first <unk> the energy , you see here at his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> that wo n't there .
the <unk> , you come back in <unk> blood .
and also there is it 's active and <unk> still , and quiet on your <unk> .
so the sugar .
so if the energy <unk> into the blood , then talk about the physicians of high blood sugar and high <unk> .
and these sugar , the <unk> 's how <unk> , power around little hole in this <unk> .
and a lucky , floating if there , all the fat around , and that <unk> well , you about those wounds and we speak of <unk> or <unk> .
and now comes <unk> heart right under pressure , because we need now he 's blood flowing through these tight <unk> pots into the pumps and we speak of blood pressure .
and if this pressure , in such a <unk> true , then makes it also in the body <unk> .
and if that the heart was happening , then we call the heart attack .
and if that in mind has happened then we call the stroke .
and also in germany and dies every second of heart attack and the stroke .
that go in germany and dies every second of <unk> .
and mike gets so not so sick , because he did not exercising , according to not because he does n't even more than moving .
and if you this context or not know , looking for you always on the wrong place .
for example , about diet .
i have degrees ' `` yesterday . diet in the amazon 's entered and get there <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , basis .
and if each book that 's an inch is thick and we were the here <unk> , we would have a 30 feet high tower , the current <unk> <unk> .
and i was the time for you read all .
and there is inside and now that 's really important if you more energy to take and so more food as they consume and then they get fat .
and if you less energy goes as they consume and then you will be thin .
that 's brilliant .
but why we need to <unk> books ?
that makes one thing to .
this desire is obviously , huge , but <unk> is to do n't help .
because why it fails of diet , a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet is , and not a lifestyle .
what we opt in the action , let 's just three weeks , and here , five weeks , if we then , after this struggle , again in the normal day back , to our ordinary lifestyle .
what are then , after five or seven weeks ?
nothing .

so you allowed to go today with any new diet , with any new <unk> ask you can , and you like this in their day-to-day , and in your lifestyle to integrate this .
yes or no ?
and if you know , then <unk> .
and if no , let 's just stay .
because if i ended up with nothing clustered up , it 's strictly a waste .
there are the habits , to decide whether we get sick or stay healthy .
there are the bad habits , ill .
and there are the good behavior of us healthy .
and if mike , in the mirror , look , then he look up with the result of a daily lifestyle .
if mike , in the mirror , we look , then he look up their daily habits .
and if mike , in the mirror , look , and to be honest , is , then he look as well , where he is driving .
because when he 's more bad habits , as well , then it 's just in the disease ravaged his way .
and if mike , in the way to move towards wellness -- kind of its goals , it would overflow its dreams come to get it 's not having his life forbid .
then he need to just more good behavior as bad .
and a <unk> habits and mike 's also a great example that the human being used to have a weird animal is .
mike 's for example , managed to move out completely his day <unk> by it every way to the driving home every escalator , using , everybody to lift the use .
and night is anywhere he <unk> on the couch , and we need to somehow <unk> , moving from .
so , putting it , in his <unk> ride into the gym where with the escalator up what you know , per se , and paradox is , and then becomes like this ai n't a rat , again in such a band <unk> , so he somehow , moving from .
and my grandpa did that , just so amusing , as you .
the was a farmer and the have heard that did n't understand .
the said , sport is for people who does n't move .
and somehow he 's also true .
why we need at night in our most precious leisure time that effectively compensate for what we the ground lost have ?
is strictly have done , we have today with this <unk> lifestyles after two hours of sports can make a day .
and if only it 's much easier to the vibrating back up to find where we do you 've lost .
the ground .
and so <unk> ' i do you today to a shift to invite you .
maybe even know , they also the situation , you drive the evening again , as a shopping to and gotten out , in the front row — no room for free .
and what you see how hard of wired for this <unk> in us .
we always wants to the shortest , due to go .
we plan our homes and so that we the <unk> have a way .
we plan our whole life that we the <unk> have a way , but that brings us , but not going to this , where we <unk> .
but in a very different direction .
so we get them off now the <unk> activate and the vibrating back out , where they degrees of shows up .
i <unk> one example , chew with the trajectory .
and i 'm the only , the time up and down and up and down on and everybody else .
but if i mean , ever since i 'm then <unk> ' i mean , the time for me .
then <unk> ' i mean , the movement , that 's just like yourselves today lies .
and if from above the <unk> comes to 30 minutes <unk> , say `` i <unk> .
<unk> steps .
that are about three times 10 minutes of translation .
and a <unk> <unk> steps , if you go to double every day <unk> steps more go then , that means that you end of day , 12 grams of fat , not in your body <unk> .
this may be relatively little sound .
but as <unk> , as a habit established , even <unk> days , and then we talk about four point five pounds of fat .
that we 're not in our bodies .
and you give me degrees ' time that , i <unk> `` it always <unk> .
the americans are going crazy , the question , so what here .
this is a <unk> of five pounds of fat .
are <unk> ' i four pounds .
just to show you 'll see , what 's going to those little baby steps .
and if that the effect is from this shift , what you mean , what happened just happened , if you really in an active life took off .
and this <unk> that i do , you go to double every day in their day-to-day .
once you at <unk> steps per day to get there are , walk you virtually every <unk> them .

they then next to the <unk> even <unk> .
then they will also even faster and stronger .
but do with them to your health , depending of sports .
so you make your health , depending on , fed and of their time .
because the most important , the critical to do that they 're going on every day when western lifestyles .
and i <unk> `` an active lifestyle <unk> .
and for me , it 's now more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a <unk> that on a clear that decision based on for the lives and for myself .
because i think , health has not to do with , what we should do , or do need to work .
but health has to do with , what we want to do .
and so <unk> ' i 'm just one more idea for them .
you decide to pull off now just yet for the best .
and off now you can also how can .
step at a .
thank you .
<unk> how it 's a leonardo , da vinci , actually done in such unbelievable , and bail way of the world with others have to see ?
and putting yourself as far on that engage in what to his time , just simply inconceivable , inconceivable , was ?
we could do it is also now ?
that , maybe what to <unk> to do ?
and how do we strength from and confidence , for the future to draw ?
we start , but let 's on with the question what do we actually pull out of innovation ?
yeah .
technology and invention of research and development , even the official <unk> the federal government has the title <unk> the federal government .
so you know about me , right .
well that 's all great .
and we can with quite proud that , and be grateful that we <unk> in such a lot of the fields are that our <unk> around the world we 're needed it to us good to go .
that we do with a way , amazing , unique , wealth 've developed .
but what it with the future from ?
those challenges that come , as a society based on us to ?
and who care , because there to the major environmental and social engineering challenges ?
so <unk> `` it seems like `` fine .
a kind of division .
so the economy is taking care , the environmental challenges , because the entrepreneurs , big effort , we then the productivity and efficiency of increase .
and that the world better do want to find yourself in the nonprofit entities , and clubs and <unk> and they have to actually , what do so basically all the non-market course , then to the damage the capitalist in the economy to remove themselves .
at least <unk> to fix .
but who says , because that we all this as separate , you need ?
how about it because if we <unk> to this ai social and cultural dimension to extend compassion ?
if technological innovation also cultural innovation are ?
if economic innovation also happen in the social innovation are ?
if it us <unk> entrepreneurial thinking and doing sent to self-assemble with the solution large environmental and social engineering challenges ?
if it very different previously unknown forces <unk> and if it us <unk> a very different , and fair <unk> development to promote positive ?
because what was that ?
both sides were so , but what companies , right ?
can do it ?
ask you might be dealing with .
so far we that yes , as a contradiction considered .
luckily , there 's encouraging examples .
muhammad yunus , with his <unk> , with his <unk> in bangladesh is incredibly many really cares about the poverty , there <unk> .
and interestingly , too much more precise moment in direct <unk> of what the federal <unk> done .
and he has <unk> as entrepreneurs , i would also begun to the <unk> <unk> get .
in the opportunity because i think about a i <unk> ' they still with anyone familiar to do .
allow , i must imagine <unk> <unk> .


and yes , so totally <unk> .
i love the cage like .
and if you to see , then you think , oh boy , at the offspring , because we need to us to our future , you do n't worry .
yes , right after the banjo , he then here somewhere , starting to work on our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that does he also very good .
that matches his celebrity and there 's also very successful .
and yet , something inside there are so in him .
so he asks , there 's not even more , that somehow , i 'm going strong ?
so that this entrepreneurial , he says , whatever .
<unk> are very well , in all <unk> .
and that you liked him too .
and he had fallen as these <unk> .
so the right there 's also the <unk> , he 's going to get detected .
so not that he would , personally , if you know , but it comes from <unk> tell him , you know what .
and there was in the middle class in the t , three n , i knew he did n't .
so even more effective , he was surprised when the him , and then the <unk> personally was introduced .
when mister <unk> .

the janitor 's great pleasure raises , so with young people together , where its own experience <unk> .
and the two , then plummeted line found .
and have , makes a duck hit .
how about it because if we just like in one of those conversations from the two times <unk> ?
yes , mister <unk> , so how did this because again , right .
what 's right now the difference between <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> company ?
that i still not as fully understood .

so the name says it , yes .
conventional markets , conventional products , conventional customers , conventional structures , there 's a <unk> .
and you can also quite closely projections to go to be , where the huge entities , <unk> .
and you ai ai <unk> , the very neat name is that capacity too .
what 's because then actually a <unk> ?
so , <unk> , you <unk> been so one is it just do n't guarantee it 's just not the small copy of a big company .
it 's something very different .
it , a radically different character .
because it 's got hold anything <unk> .
no <unk> customers , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
of why is a <unk> a temporary organization of the purpose to serve a business to look , to find , to develop the profitable to do is , but , would reproduceably put it , then they scale it .
and you will piss you understand that it sounds of course , so <unk> organization , very different kind of a different perfectly , there , very different <unk> , very different ways .
yes , that 's what i 've been clear .
but after what we look really ?
so , i <unk> ' time , then it 's a stop there 's drum at least amount <unk> <unk> to make money right ?

that means <unk> .
how you know your business success <unk> and after the <unk> your life for <unk> did .
oh no .
really <unk> ?
what you think , because if you with the beginning , solid your <unk> money did what you keep your <unk> ?
so <unk> you just a career as passive , <unk> or what ?
what if you with your commitment , i know you ?
and also , let 's time the <unk> .
so the statistics about <unk> give you do n't <unk> perspective , because seventy percent <unk> are very few years before , then in a much worse financial situation when the front of their major free .

yeah , money is a source for an enterprise <unk> .
and it is the foundation all economic <unk> .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yes , which is then the goal ?
of the company ?
so , i guess what upset . ' i got 'em , but i learned , so without the goal is no way the right .
and so , these goals , we would mean more specifically in measurably <unk> may be and so forth .
and if i think that it 's not get 'em , so that as i can do n't search of , i do n't know what i 'm not supposed to ?
so that i do n't feel good .
so how do i , because we decide , and risk everything that feeling , for me anything like a vague , and <unk> .
yes , <unk> welcome to the enterprise .
but i got 'em , maybe what for you .
a thread .
so the is yes , <unk> , so almost never been a secret .
successful <unk> by generation to generation intelligences on .
a <unk> for wined .
so , or how to tell you today ?
<unk> <unk> ' i , <unk> ?
so we say , jesus , always <unk> to .

so help save them .
i <unk> ' , i can you one of devices .
okay .
yes , thanks , mister <unk> .
but there are very well , just ask you put more .
that can you 'll just remember one of the most important an enterprise qualities , is good question to ask .
we in the time one after the other to pass me to the perhaps better understand ?
so the first is what i 'm here and what i want this difference ?
yes , <unk> , because it <unk> what drives you know that about you move beyond that 's bigger than to be you ?
what <unk> you the world ?
what have the people of them , if you with you work ?
what you prepared to be ?
what are your pipes , may well , unconscious <unk> ?
why is that important that to see ?
because that are also your business enterprise <unk> .
and how we do this of learning ?
if you a ship to build these guys , and then <unk> not the men together bits of a hot , of wood to collect , but i teach them , yearning for the infinite , an unending world , the ocean .
yes , well .
so then <unk> i let me the next questions .
what 's my <unk> <unk> ?
which means that ?
yes , <unk> now , thou shalt you know your goal really ever conceived .
colorful conceived in detail , colorful , but i <unk> `` you 'll have a huge when you <unk> , what you do n't want to then there is going to get stuck just stay .
you know , the story with the pink and elephants ?
when i think there 's degree .
not ?
<unk> .
so , pass first step up .
<unk> you 'll never goes pink and elephants .
okay ?
it does it ?
so no turning pink and elephants .
understand ?
no turning pink and elephants .
you see ?
so you go to us , if we so put your focus on this , what we do n't want .
what is there are the only way ?
because focusing on <unk> ?
yes , yeah , <unk> `` you that , what you want .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the <unk> the <unk> .
but <unk> 's some rough .
the way , what i just mind are you got tattoos and yet <unk> right ?
i got 'em from you 've got a brought .
<unk> time , if you <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> lord smith .

and <unk> what it out ?
you know what we noticed ?
, something changed ?
okay .
okay , and the flower , too .
okay .
so , let 's time , then , let 's where the bear rainforest is .
and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> lord smith .
who ?

i <unk> <unk> of youtube , `` race <unk> nonstop <unk> <unk> t <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> culinary world .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i of what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i of what <unk> artwork <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> lady , smith .
and <unk> , you go to you do ?
so , i know , i was also be shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i the first got 'em .
i thought it know we can do n't think was being .
and even more shocking , i was when i plunged through the mind has gone bust is it might be that i actually the entire time that way through the area over ?
by my life .
and okay , i mean that does mean totally new sense .
to go up the immediate <unk> to prevent that we that most of our perception and our <unk> guys , <unk> need .
but what 's because now , at ?
what <unk> ' i was and what <unk> ' i 'm from ?
and therefore <unk> , encouraging you your perception and specifically , somewhere <unk> to it ai n't other major entrepreneurial quality .
well , yes , thanks , then we get it 's time to the next question .
how could i really have to my get ?
so , i find that this ai n't good question .
the follow up , `` i 'm going every time , and you know that somehow not to forward .
yes , <unk> , there 's it ai n't good news for you .
that you get lighter and fall when you may have been known did .

most naturally .
you will not unlike that 's less than that a brainstorming , you 're headed to things on your business development .
that are then these famous <unk> , you wake of the shower , did .
and there ai n't question i recommend you at the spot , check out for good to , who you integrate could who you to asking for advice tape around there more water input , more powerful lens with home to get .
and you 've also a huge role .
the <unk> have this magnificent <unk> .
<unk> di <unk> , if the no longer going to know , has the in his <unk> invited back in florence .
for lunch at the famous big table .
and it 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politicians to bankers , by traders -- engineers , architects and it ai n't very intense <unk> fostered .
but not in our present and so , where 's drum up , yes , who set out through ?
who 's right ?
but rather than to that got out of these different <unk> things came that are the way up with no way of one of the province had to come to .
well , yes , the next question is what good concrete next step i do ?
<unk> there are doing , it more successful entrepreneur in the reason so simple .
instead of the size of planning and management and so forth and enable them , just in the next step .
because what do you , because in terms of uncertainty and also do ?
but the result in this really determined and with all the consequence out .
and if it 's and then nothing was well , dan do you look , jesus <unk> one step .
and even when the big , colorful <unk> <unk> nothing was then there 's a stop this ai n't other .
it 's why it 's so important that you know your purpose is clear .
that gives you are connected national security .
and the way as we actually have all we’ve learnt from ?
although we that yes , do n't know , and it wo n't somebody said it ?
are commonly do you there 's also <unk> with kids .
so , this playful and learn that is a search and this <unk> playful image search , it 's also , that 's fun doing that in a company is happening in a <unk> .
and that 's also just sort of the <unk> against the uncertainty , otherwise , so anxious you .
yes , thanks ! mister <unk> .
so that sounds like , yes , very good at .
but i do n't know , with me in the company , i <unk> ' there we need to get many more of your boss to change that 's something happened .
and their own set up here in germany , there 's always like this gives the mood .
and i <unk> ' , there 'd have the politicians calling guys , for sure that , to change .
okay my boy , come with .
how do this time , down to the water .
what you think , many people can you change ?
10 ?
10 thousand ?
ten million ?
look here , down .
who you see ?
alright , the .
this is the you change can , you really change can .
or about it , mahatma gandhi to say , looking at the change that you in the world , looking into your own .
you think you really beautiful words and huge role models , but how do that appear to work ?

helpful in all sorts <unk> of crisis , or if you too small , you feel for something or if you a famished cubicle and they all with you to do .
and if you in these situations they should ask what am pleased up now despite the child i follow up ' watch out of posture , you take you can physically close to you very powerful to feel .
follow up , you , but the time , what you out of <unk> like , the you 're <unk> .
and it finally , to follow up , you , what you actually from this crisis , or the , what 's bad happened is because i did .
so i , if it you already happening is going to give it at least worth it has .
yeah well .
mr <unk> thank you .
and you think that you want to me that helps on my enterprise way ?
yes , right .
and encouraging you do so , two things .
first time in eight to the clarity of your inner <unk> , then to your enterprise for this is .
because that determines your perception .
and to the second an eighth place on your inner attitude to herself facing .
because it <unk> you like the other people , you to behave .
the future is only time , if we do our own change perceptions .
<unk> you went to figure this ?
yes , i <unk> ' time .
thanks ! mister <unk> well then .
all good <unk> <unk> .
yes .
what you think about our <unk> ?
nice .
indeed , or , <unk> ?
and how we hold it because now , with this <unk> ?
it is a new <unk> ?
i mean , yes .
clearly .
which i do so , the <unk> see .

and this is , what the <unk> really makes us .
a <unk> from some potions for the euphoria .
and no , so new <unk> , <unk> .
now there 's the <unk> .
the right <unk> been in the big , famous saying , <unk> .
from robert , bosch , about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> or how they all the hot .
let 's just that spirit to animate them .
and who knows that might be yes , from our <unk> the next of leonardo of our time .
you see the right , i 'm <unk> .
maybe it would be so intuitive to me to me with kids and their future i 'm concerned , because after they 're going to our future .
instead is that the view , i the most of hyper-intelligent coral .
i spend a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , my father and i do this program <unk> , entrepreneurship , for prisoners , created .
we technically qualify <unk> entrepreneurial , that means you can , into custody , either casually , or find for their <unk> lighter one the workplace , they actually , can hold .
why the gardening , i do chairs being used to <unk> , so those who had failed are the big mistake i did ?
our program is far not as easy to understand how things that the eye care for children .
and frankly i thought that the <unk> the last place in the universe is , where i work would .
do you know , is the most critical lack of a factor in the child with the people with that we work ?
we discovered , there are positive models as often the male , positive models .
and if you think about , why it in certain <unk> so many <unk> and so many <unk> are often it 's because it 's what that the father 's no sensible things work has that he drinks , he drugs , consumes one or that he himself in prison is anywhere .
and if then one of young think about what it from his life do want it may not even better idea , as a different lives might look , because he had no better models .
and he <unk> his father .
i <unk> `` you , martin , imagine .
martin 's <unk> our program .
his father was an alcoholic and made the entire family life of that the hell .
when he was 12 signature was is his mother died , and he and his baby brother who had to go home .
there , it was the <unk> the great .
he was shy , and <unk> and so the perfect person .
to the day as being a little baby brother , in a soccer game so roughly <unk> been is that the bottom are stuck .
there was burned at martin , i first the <unk> , he went on the enemy off and proposed to .
and down , that day , he was respect .
and it went off .
violence was part of now , to his life the same for his father .
what 's now at the person , i just described -- well , next ?
after the child and after the youth who are lots of unemployed or have <unk> .
you 're not much more than your illegal activities and their <unk> <unk> .
and then they become one day with people in jail dmca that 's just like this is , their minds around the x-ray beams that also not a better models are .
about what , you think , think these people along after , if you together in prison for your chairs ?
mostly about not much good .
and they 're getting better criminals are in <unk> .
they sell those buckets , drugs on a higher levels and plan , in custody , where you to the custody <unk> could .
and that adds up in germany to <unk> of <unk> percent .

then there , but also people in prison , really change want .
but also , these people wear a <unk> the broad forehead .
and there 's <unk> .
and everywhere , where they come , is that your first building identity .
if you a mobile workplace , you look , if you an apartment for you know if you to private build a relationship to wherever you 're going to this identity , with this <unk> face , you one of others reenter society in the society so indefinitely expandable hard power .
this is the problem , , we face .
how we 're trying to this problem to solve ?
what property , you think , bringing lots <unk> with ?
they will be surprised .
there are more entrepreneurial skills .
who have a <unk> set it 's definitely no idea of <unk> , of <unk> and of <unk> .
the only the subject <unk> it 's a little <unk> , because if only one he 's not in prison landed .
these characteristics we want to something positive energy efficient .
we start our program with a <unk> education in prison , in three <unk> .
we get all the basics of entrepreneurship and the economy .
every note to write their own <unk> and everybody gets on a comprehensive <unk> part .
and then you 'll let people are also for the custody at the <unk> , <unk> at the <unk> your personal relations and also in a possible <unk> .
what to <unk> go there from our agenda forward ?
it 's a wide range , from <unk> to the agency for <unk> .
we have a <unk> and <unk> .
a very high range and to <unk> ' i do you 'd naíma imagine .
<unk> entrepreneurial , talent and his illusion of the very fast enough money to have him , very early to trade with the cocaine seduced .
he had always fun , as a business to run .
he 's then <unk> i first got arrested .
and that into custody it was n't very impressed me .
all the opposite .
he says , ourselves now , he got back in its second custody ready .
<unk> is he then to the second time , convicted .
and he was then only one of therapy part and then at <unk> .
and there was there 's how he would be entrepreneurial , talent for something <unk> can use .
he 's in september ages been released , then october <unk> its energy agency for <unk> started .
the agency 's neat , he can now of life .
it , very good <unk> <unk> .
he 's going to me here .

again , back to martin , from where i gave him to start to tell you had .

and because alcohol , and drugs , there on the agenda are was his circle of very quickly started .
he worked in parallel when the dj , and as <unk> .
twenty years , he ran this lifetime .
and he says , today , it to go back with this fabulous lifestyle to do n't <unk> confidence <unk> .
one day to hurt it does anyone in a <unk> so hard that he then he convicted by the world .
he took on <unk> part and that <unk> there 's really his life changed .
he learned , and it to more force to more success and to over a grant you could come with his <unk> to make juice or without drugs to eat .
and he was from your insights from so excited that he had decided that would like he likes to pass .
and he wanted to be part of <unk> be .
it 's unclear ] .
he works well since the extent , two years at us and <unk> our participants in its way in the freedom , because he knows , ourselves that , if you really do something like , and if you the right tools to look at the hand , get that much more possible is when you 're oftentimes i want .
the basis of these successes are the way people like you .
people , with us in jail for getting the to external loose associations with us to come to our participants in their <unk> , with your personal plans to base hospital .
that are our <unk> , the <unk> principals into our class felt that are students who <unk> do , <unk> the <unk> assessment .
and that are our mentors , our subjects , right after the custody along .
and also these people take a lot of our program with .
one example .
we do on our events , an exercise , <unk> calls .
we glue , in the middle of space a big you’ll our participants are the one and we get bored , standing on the other hand .
and i 'm then , different question .
and every time , if anyone in space that question , `` yes -- answers to kick it on the line .
and here shows , what we all have that , if we need radicalism of prison sit or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and an example , where the differences are , is following question .
i 'm in whats called the social focal point up , i had a member , what 's ever been in custody .
there are usually a lot of our participants in front of the line , a very few of our bored .
a question that i 'd point , all together , the <unk> ' i like you ask .
that i urge you that they all the sudden stood up .
maybe we had a little light given the audience .
i can you see .
there are all .
terrific .
thank you .
i <unk> `` you 're a question , and if you that question , `` yes , answering back and they come back down , otherwise would remain they just stand .
this is sort of our our line , we 're moving .
i have in my life of illegal done things , for the i have held accountable to be able to it was n't .
if you that question , `` yes , answering back , please .
that counts , drunk driver of risks to be .

that counts , the seat , not quite actually have them .
okay .
and it matters too to think that might have any workforce , not always completely accurate and signed up to have .
all right .
most of the seats .
we have a couple of the angel in space .
that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy .
thank you , they 're allowed to all over again , sit down .
in this question , if we run around the events to ask , come to be bored , a lot of the cement floor .
and many will also clear , how much greater happiness is it may have had .
happiness with the parents , happiness with the environment , they were growing , with the friends , but also very fortunate that you may not always what you get caught 're anything you on the edge of <unk> or even in addition to you did .
what are the results of our work ?
<unk> percent of our alumni , from within <unk> days after their <unk> a desk .
this is rapidly moving fast .
<unk> percent , having mobile apps .
a third of the donors are in the last year was <unk> .
and our <unk> is about seven percent .
i did it already told the <unk> of seven percent is a <unk> in germany , <unk> percent of acceptance .
i 'm <unk> .
a <unk> costs in <unk> year , taxpayers <unk> dollars .
and it 's a beautiful <unk> , <unk> what a <unk> of seven percent of us to a <unk> of typically <unk> percent for a compact , meaning .
when my father and i do that <unk> started to have , we are quite frankly , pretty much for quite nuts delivered the world .
i was my great <unk> in a big businesses , given up .
but i must tell you , i in my life , not as a <unk> work done .
we encourage our subjects to take responsibility to take .
responsibility , which in your life 's happened and so , responsibility for them to adopt , which in their lives will happen .
they 're not to hide , nothing to whitewash .
because that leads to a whole new social confidence and allow it also the face again , trust to build .
and therefore it makes me very happy and pride and when our subjects to embrace of its way to tell us .
dative , i took them a little video , brought .
that tape .
so i was destined to two years , and eight months , because of a dangerous <unk> .
i was because <unk> against the <unk> to three years , and 10 months , convicted .

so , i have a judgment of received two years , because of a dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation in <unk> , actually my complete life changed .
and what to me was important , was this <unk> that are also do .
because there was my yes , my absolute <unk> .
i was n't <unk> , edit ' i close to say , yes .
i went back goals , and as the tip .
i quit after another way discovered i go ahead to watched .
and you go with a very different historical awareness and confidence from the custody out .
so far it more <unk> without a fixed these goals and then is you stop in and something <unk> .
with the wrong people together and this now , it .
well , the problem is that many of any <unk> have to the <unk> .
that the biggest problem , because it 's automatically <unk> , that you go back in the old <unk> coming .
you know you know anything else .
by this <unk> individual <unk> , however , what 's all being offered is , with me just all my thinking about me put themselves , about other , the people interact with issues , the people interact with the society , that , with me just as those 20 weeks , shot .
i 've been <unk> of my first woman in divorce .
and since internationally , six months . bye '' i stood up with her .
so that means , we have a new relationship started .
and because i found myself among them either through this whole <unk> and many other things that changed 'em .
so much 'em , i already done .
i 'm with my family back in plain the education started .
so i work today in my <unk> , edit ' i say .
i do 'official ' catcher 's a <unk> to <unk> .
you have that actually acknowledge that 's very , many people are the fact , for example , my mentor , now also about this time , moreover , and actually about being , i do n't know , <unk> engagement , beyond the people to support .
i 'm grateful for you to the idea at all came here are you to be so what do .
i 'm grateful for that it 's in spite of security more trouble <unk> have and i 'm extremely grateful that i was part of his having me .
this part of course , all the people , the support , and they were .
i like i said , with many people at the events was talking , and the me , confirmed , which is good , that makes all epicures .
and there 's not push ' i 's also do .
and to say `` i thank you .
they come up with us in jail .
any of you have something that we need to .
if you our participants in their <unk> base , as the <unk> to us to see if you in the frame of a financial support that are .
if you know , our program in a new <unk> want to wear , <unk> issue .
you 're talking about us , please .
martin naíma and i are here today .
and rejoice with us on the conversation with them .
thank you .
<unk> i sold at <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> in nepal <unk> .
in a time , i do something , surely was .
there is that makes you know , and things .
now , because <unk> h.r .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in a convent , let me .
there is yes , today really are many ways as you with <unk> manage it .
<unk> how you <unk> manage it .
anyway , i was <unk> well , surely .

which i 'm here 's move from <unk> talk .
and not from real problems .
my problem was i was <unk> and able to me very precisely conceived as your life in tens of wars , 30 years will look .
it was <unk> .
and this <unk> i thought , frightening .
about it is spawning express .
basically , i had a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
a living as private .
i did n't do i have the <unk> road rage ?
do it me just lazy way ?
or what if i mean <unk> back to throw this ?
and look , `` what happens .
what then on me wait .
that were so the idea .
i was in this time , free <unk> at a refuge .
so as i <unk> .
the <unk> was for me , despite <unk> the absolute <unk> .
you <unk> free the world 's living in very good hotels and <unk> this country on a very <unk> way of .
<unk> but occasionally , very <unk> countries .
and developing countries where it sure anymore to see , and say that there was about forerunner of these villages , that’s <unk> local people who , though they have nothing , much greater happiness and joy <unk> .
the same kind of these images and from cliché about living , but a <unk> certain way too .
and so that was for me after a while the quantity .
i was that what i did too much .
the surface .
moreover , i thought it 's a little <unk> of me about a country to write to judge that i really do n't really know .
that i wanted to change .

to <unk> article , to write .
and to my personal interest to be breastfeeding .
how you 're learning has been doing better know ?
by you with the people who lives .
in the people living , with them home .
not in the hotel .
by that , with the challenges and with the problems of people engaged .
and by you with the people who works .
anyway -- that was the answer that i look at this question i could be .
and that i wanted to do .
moreover , i wanted something meaningful to do .
i wanted a contribution .
to do good .
and this sense , with me , at a <unk> further . it increases .
i was that he said before you often in developing world , nepal , i just a particularly touched .
until <unk> elder gave up one of civil war , not only through numerous and orphans , but also plenty of economic and social problems , and left .
with an annual income per capita from <unk> euros of nepal is the poorest country in asia .
and counting its continued to the two decades , the poorest countries the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
almost a fifth of the population suffer of malnutrition .
forty percent of the adult can do n't read and write .
all these facts are connected with very many personal stories and experiences that i do on this tour of electroconvulsive hit me in a time , i was willing and frank was to change .
in my own little change i want .
and drum up after my return of nepal , my decision , swampy .
i quit my job .
and applied to me at the aid .
and i <unk> `` now , just an excerpt from the answer <unk> that i on my job application received .
because they just a kind of the site .
it 's about a serious application in <unk> international beneficiaries of the business .
and not a to <unk> for a <unk> <unk> the stop at the time in nepal , i want , and a funding of your <unk> addiction .
hi ?
it yet ?
my job application was really serious a well-intentioned and good .
at least i thought that .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .

and finding 'em , having a very emotional response was writing .
and luckily , never <unk> .
instead 'em , i found that 's very intense , feeling down to what good <unk> to do .
i did it 's used as a motor , to my own business to create .
<unk> .

a company that basically , that offers , what i was looking to have .
which is to a country unlike the riches .
the way of a country right speed meet .
by me with the people in place to live and can work .
and that 's not telling you can work , but in the clips <unk> .
<unk> you can actually in two words , break .
so karma , and <unk> .
that means much , as a place on that we 're good so karma can gather together .
the the you do good can .

but it 's not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use the tourism , as a tool for sustainable development .
<unk> we 're using <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so <unk> , volunteering and unsustainable tourism .
because the people , with us to travel down payment as your <unk> useful volunteering .
they pay for their journey , as with a different organizers .
but they travel out of different .
you live in <unk> .
and the main objective is not least amount of recovery or at least amount of <unk> not attempting <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and <unk> .
i get engaged , our subjects , according to and qualification , and interests in various projects .
we can go through our work for a <unk> tourism , in the regions of encouraging the otherwise , not getting on the classic tourism that would .
because just the inside the infrastructure to practice .
for others , we can send sustainable food projects will increase .
we can reduce their sustainable food projects that initiate and funding .
we pay for us so to 100 percent of itself .
are also not on donating to depend .

have started to let the work <unk> in nepal .
<unk> year we have our activism on uganda <unk> .
and so after about four years turned out of us now i got married and my husband and i are also hired a team of <unk> question .
we go in the <unk> to so forth ?
or what if we even greater think ?
if we the <unk> more strongly believe ?
if we 're going to develop not just a social engagement and sustainable trips i think it 's happening in his wholeness embrace ?
and so that , the individual <unk> integrate this ?
or more or specialty individual <unk> .
that would then , really a new one extra company .
a company , that , their attention .
with other <unk> but the same scholars like <unk> .
we want to this ?
i was the next question .

sure that we want this .
we are passionate entrepreneur and their creative companies .
because we 'll be ticking .
because we the same language .
because we the same as dreams were dreaming .
because we the challenges to understand .
and why we 've done in this year <unk> one sister , given .
<unk> .
and with <unk> we push creative companies in its development and to initiate <unk> that we by shooting percentages of people to support .
to accompany we the cooperators , entrepreneur , or a team members of creative companies with individual human development <unk> .
so <unk> the personal social and <unk> development of <unk> contain .
and <unk> the <unk> prepare .
the world there at <unk> , again .
a tour of the next to a meaningful <unk> another one more advantage .
he shows a in relatively short time , where you 're standing or where you <unk> .
where you might even the psyche biases .
where you may have to make compliant , is , to <unk> in thinking .
and he shows a on , what you really good .
this one of his strength of eyes .
it if the creativity , suddenly there 's great .
or whether it 's the serenity , you start again , they discovered .
of serenity and things we assume that you do n't can change .
and the power , things to change that you can change .
and you can be very much change .
already in very short time .
we know that .
one example , on .
that are <unk> rose <unk> , named lydia and <unk> .
that are five very beautiful women from uganda .

they separate towers , beautiful , <unk> <unk> years .
and the years was nothing .
because they simply no market for it had .
because they did n't know , the quality , we can improve .
because you nobody has said , which design , maybe in the question is coming .
we wanted to these women help .
and have so in this year , <unk> started .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
they buy the people out of poverty , get .
that you an income there .
a future in order .
we 're beautifully yesterday with our <unk> real estate megaprojects gone .

a <unk> of thousands <unk> of our women .
the sales that gives them not just for a year of an income .
it allows us as well , this project , very much bigger .

so you 're sponsoring you want to be like this , with the purchase a chain of doing for others , it could , but with us either directly into the project , travel .
he 's able to the women are traveling and they 're actively <unk> .
long-term investments we 're not only five women of give it fifty or a hundred .
and that 's not only in uganda , but also in nepal and in other <unk> , in which we <unk> work .
what is , but this <unk> just a project from our new integrated cycle on projects .
we 're working in all the core areas .
in <unk> <unk> templates for health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work in one field just too much .
what happens with the kids when the women who work ?
right .
so we have in this year in nepal and in uganda , two <unk> centre , started .
it reaches into our own cycle of fall .
and all this makes more sense , as each project for yourself .
participants in place where we 've ever , qualification into the various projects .
the exact ways they have then always been in the joint effort .
and to leave me tell you 're more directly on a journey to bring them .
and that i urge you the eyes to close .
<unk> `` you before you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting on a wooden dining table .
and they 're happy , and tired .
you 're dealing with your <unk> to lunch is eaten .
there <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
there 's pleasurable to warm .
you <unk> out the window .
and see these kids in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet of the sand on .
you <unk> on your <unk> .
well , you it 's a thin coat <unk> dust .
the kids will laugh .
and calls for fun to your name .
you <unk> you that they do n't more just <unk> call .
<unk> .
you know , not , what time it 's .
but soon , you going up .
and the <unk> , the room , the children and passed , <unk> .
at the street is a tree .
here you going up with lydia meet .
in the meadow , sitting in the shadows of the tree as you will the new designs they <unk> repeat .
how whenever you will work with your hands and feet to talk .
later come , the other women on this .
they smile , you <unk> .
until you with your english <unk> .
under the tree .
in free-fall .
amazingly , it 's still an internet , there .
this morning <unk> you back with your coach .
it <unk> you .
the exchange is every time value .
it 's also pretty , once in german , to talk .
you 're hearing the music .
and that <unk> of <unk> .
mom <unk> washing in the courtyard , the pots .

you are lazy and happy .
you know the eyes up to do .
each of us , <unk> to come to what 's something new engage .
now , or for a short time that cube , again , how to throw away .
and to look what happens .
thank you .

i 'm chairman says , let 's not as well , but perhaps want to any sign .
down here by chairman says `` i want somebody .
two .
here for the top chairman says `` i could n't , but , down there are ever had two , that 's beautiful , we 're ever to <unk> .
i got 'em , which is also a building occupied and that the <unk> mountain in east , the city <unk> .
this is the building .
with two decades , the other people got 'em , i the <unk> in the last summer , six months , i had been occupying brain .
and so <unk> ' i 'm here tonight , you .
well , and , like now some of you might say .
what 's also ?
<unk> is it , in a lot .
but i want it quickly explain .
oh , which , you are occupied by now the <unk> ?
and you <unk> then the park or how ?
one small sample of the questions that we know , friends , colleagues have asked when you 've learned that i think part of an initiative , i <unk> ' to , something <unk> name , <unk> am .
all we expected that we will seamlessly in the number of <unk> <unk> had .
and here , around these <unk> <unk> built were , <unk> endemic diseases and the banner '' did .
and to guard against the privatization of <unk> to stop protesting .
but whoever taught me , if you know , you know that 's not my kind of <unk> .
and it was also not the elected <unk> the initiative .
what we see here , is a sign of the <unk> passage in <unk> .
this is a public space , the evidence that 's private sector is , and so for many people do n't available to it says , <unk> ' i do n't say , but it 's not in public hand is , and why not that could be used how to improve public spaces may take advantage .
we were a group of <unk> together in the desire to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , sensitive and sustainable to deal .
and we wanted a different <unk> tell .
we were a <unk> team and that has i 'm very quickly see , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the areas of architecture , planning , social -- , politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design , music , photography <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
obviously also happen , at different social and cultural and personal <unk> .
our perspectives <unk> and <unk> .
and have allowed us , at different skills , but also on various networks <unk> .
and creative in part unconventional solutions in the <unk> , and then we did have to <unk> to realize .
we 've actually navigated to the <unk> to occupy .
however , about us about that we the <unk> with stories and try to occupy .
we have to memories and images being asked .
and of those memories and images out of trying to be improved outlook for the <unk> to develop .
and it was we care that the process more constructive ; it 's left .
us as an initiative , we have , and i always as <unk> platform and as <unk> terms .
so i was <unk> a <unk> and emotive occupy , and better to a <unk> .
the experiences that we know what did , <unk> ' i tonight to go .
every city has <unk> places .
the a neighborhood a face to give .
in many cases of these end of and <unk> and be in the result of citizens , strangers are places are perceived slights .
they are the deaths from places in a city because it 's a lot is not the equivalent to what we 're in a public space and expect .
so for example that we <unk> have to <unk> have .
are these , but also the fact , public , the urban places , neglected , is a lot <unk> .
these initiatives , the places like head radiologist want to stay often too <unk> interest , in its infancy , put them .
what 's also with me to do n't like this is a few questions , like some outside of questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places to give our cities -- not just a face .
no .
they are the social places of the city , in our <unk> life is happening .

and we can these <unk> , if we saw an ai n't be able to have to sit , and we actually stop , if the spaces are also designed accordingly .

so as a form friendships , sometimes .
but what 's certainly going to bug 's a feeling of community .
more profound encounters , i 'll help in such a public 'em gets faster and it gets closer to bug 's also that community .
and when i 'm not <unk> , i come up just that , what you think of anonymity basically a big city called .
we were then , two challenges .
we can look at the citizens of consciousness , accountability and engagement for their neighborhood woken up or in <unk> also <unk> be .
how can protest in the creation be transformed ?
how can make reasonable criticism in new ideas to be transformed ?
a protest against the privatization , and <unk> this <unk> <unk> places and criticism , against the expansion and actually also not <unk> <unk> 's the same places .
you now , they sit here , even before , they beat the newspaper , and read the following the text .
i love <unk> and citizens , we invite you a we want you three kinds of options for the <unk> of <unk> imagine that an earlier , carefully for a besieged <unk> designed .
they must have in my recommendation of the idea of a nuance , pick .
and the variation in the most <unk> is then <unk> implemented .
they would go ?
would anyone from them to this event going ?
perhaps not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds the first of great .
there ai n't have a way , what <unk> .
they must <unk> of the way in the future looks .
and again , it sounds the first of love the first moment .
i try to grab me nonetheless , an explanation .
and that he said , because i the opinion , you ca n't really not join or pick up or shape , <unk> .
first , because traditional , <unk> often too late <unk> .
that means mostly they have no opportunity , really , your suggestions to make or basically the alternatives to argue , but there , ai design and they must <unk> have to decide whether they <unk> or <unk> in the city , green plants .
or , as a friend of other day said , what color the trash can have for example .
second favorite explanation of classic <unk> 's rarely about information and vote out .
you think about the three <unk> options .
we have is what that we want to show you , and they must then you can vote .
the frustration and mutual incomprehension -- are often the following what i also think it 's understandable , i find .
i certainly want to any decision about <unk> or <unk> meeting when i really prefer the ai <unk> route , instead <unk> <unk> had .
it goes , but also different .
although at the of the existing <unk> lot of conversations that cost has we finally too much <unk> experience .
so we experience to be picked up and that i 'm going to others <unk> parts .
i want to pass on others have initiatives , at other projects , but also , or so , at the <unk> and at the politics .
because it 's the ones are , the ones <unk> actually going to , and the really responsible for such manufacturing processes are .
if you 're actually really the interest in the conversion on is , how it so often <unk> and he emphasizes that is then we need and then we need the <unk> new <unk> .
not least <unk> ' i but also all of you , you today , sit here .
and that 's why , because i <unk> for a really believe .
i jesus ' it for important that they 're looking forward , and i want it with our example , encourage , the <unk> still a chance to give .
and i connect me of them all , because they are the ones that the <unk> a new <unk> demand it can .

first about willingness to the conversation on <unk> .
in <unk> come from practitioners at <unk> , citizens on <unk> and different kinds of interest , each other .
what we see here , is a picnic table , in the way we invited to have .
what we see here , are some <unk> and <unk> in conversation with citizens .
the goal to be that all these conversations on <unk> take place , so that not the <unk> interests , or the <unk> skills across the capabilities of the citizens .
the citizens , there are experts , they 're experts to their neighborhoods , you know , what you missing , which <unk> you with a place to connect , in which was a tradition , a place is , and also , what you , there 's missing .
the <unk> , particularly at the city can bring , what on <unk> level in this project a gamer is that .
in so alisa or in in a particular case , can then another <unk> be involved in the issues <unk> that 's on the project and mapped are , depending on .
all this leads to a <unk> , where we all of information for all available , are and the then the place agreed to be .
by maybe even trace to be able to an identification of nowhere to do .
a conversation on <unk> also means that the wishes , the residents in fact taken seriously .

the course , can total screwing around , but the goal to be , in <unk> conversation with all over <unk> , which is the right solution and maybe in <unk> , the <unk> asylum , but maybe at a different place .
again , it 's got out of the dialogue , and then form .
second point are diverse <unk> .
our <unk> 's colorful .
one feels , completely comfortable , when he was <unk> large group is , and you can talk .
a different from it 's good writing , i 'd like , but the text and then not going <unk> large group of energy .
one of others , ooh , perhaps better or photographing it .
or puts his ideas in <unk> <unk> on .
what i say it tries to have different <unk> going to different user is fair to be .
we have this instance , the ability to be easy to come , there to be , once stud , what happens .
the back , ai n't have a small exhibition .
we have is that opportunity had to <unk> to give .
we have the opportunity had to paint .
we have the opportunity had to write .
regardless of the age .
this was a <unk> girl .
we had to our ideas with their faces to connect to play with ideas to <unk> .
well , the ability , outside of <unk> <unk> to participate , would always been to be .
and that can for example of a <unk> happen , that can think about <unk> <unk> happen .
the <unk> and transparent that availability of the results will increase the dialogue , under the <unk> .
we even have the entire process in parallel postulate on facebook never leaves and on one of independent blog , and error page news <unk> about a <unk> distributed .
our third thing <unk> .
you remember , maybe it , i said that <unk> too late to take place .
in my <unk> event there 's been three finished <unk> .
<unk> 's the process , but then when he early intervention and the <unk> , ideally , even did n't even know , with <unk> area should happen .
if through the dialogue , and so i came back at one thing i 've got here , discussed this is what the scenarios for an area in the question .
<unk> heard , we’re going to <unk> itself .
and that then , if not from the beginning of rice mill is that the <unk> event like , and so i look , but the experiences from the previous scarcity .
what happens now , if you start having your city academics and your city <unk> .
it 's already in numerous mass of projects to see .
i got 'em up here is an example from <unk> , this is the <unk> , is probably at a lot of this is known .
in new york was just a project , because you go to a <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> there are inside of six weeks <unk> dollars to come together the funding to do now , or <unk> .
the time has to in august i wrote the politics , he could not unlike , as the idea to their own .
well , the <unk> in new york , in the way i <unk> ' i do n't tell you have , because he has to one of the key <unk> the city 's become was no idea of politics or managing dissent .
in the opposite , the <unk> for the <unk> were already discovered .

the city was told <unk> is not necessary .
the four weeks <unk> that we for <unk> <unk> have to the rich very different than <unk> out .
today is the <unk> the city , offline .
during the side <unk> d e , and it works and the city the <unk> , the initiative , there 's founded , and other <unk> support .
and elsewhere , paint having their own crossing the road .
in rotterdam formed a <unk> <unk> .
all worked as far , you want now say .
then we do , but now , just so forth .
but i think it for the wrong , the city of the responsibility to cancer .
why ?
for one , because you know , one look for a 's all have or should have .
during the most dedicated , it be the citizens of initiatives , or businesses , typically , on a for them in any shape our relevant part of focus has the city against the responsibility for reforestation projects that are also on the edge of attention .
and for one of course , the city of the projects are taking over , are other tool available to .
a <unk> initiative that this only <unk> raise .
also our goal was actually a temporary initiative , after her lifetime of imported was roughly half a year of the results and the responsibility of the vomiting starts to .

it running water have negotiations .
why we 've now , the problem is , the responsibility , not deliver those were .
but we know , already now , when the city of the <unk> successful <unk> , if the negotiation that are succeeding , then a <unk> growth will .
in what form of taking place is actually more open .
to finally , to come and i 'm convinced of that many projects , because of its meaning , complexity or whatever their expense of the city designed to have a chance of happiness that 's blessing and identification , to create .
if you just on time , and the conversation with the citizens <unk> be .
in each of the city and citizens .
in each of the city and you all that you tonight sit here .
if we inject fair , the makers in the <unk> the citizens , no longer than just annoying to sense , rather than <unk> .
this is it .
last night for the <unk> we were here in <unk> in <unk> and are like to <unk> come .
we have about <unk> talked about .
so this idea , there ai n't second chance to have , if it in life is not [ unclear ] , then it again this ai n't second chance .
we identified very exciting .
and we were , but fairly easy to us all agree that 's two things that there , we do n't even more time you see that we wanted .
this one is the awkward adolescence .
the second , there was also up every unit of the table . the school ?
no way .
no way .
school , some of you remember , maybe even <unk> out <unk> .
at me , it is yes , so , are the <unk> years ago , but the words , leading with me down to <unk> hands .
my neck <unk> , and i just want to go back on it <unk> .
and then i do n't , how it on you was , but in my exams , was then over the of the <unk> taken seriously , the sitting in the next to me .
no idea , which goes out of what 's gone .
they 're going to understand it , so , my school was n't really nice and after i then my final <unk> behind me had was perfectly clear , never again , school .
and what should i 'm saying , when i on this year <unk> <unk> some of the nicest day , i mean , spent 'em , 'em , i in schools have spent .
with great passion and completely voluntarily .
how did it that ?
like this happened ?
that started first time to make that something happens is , what i 'm not expect it could .
i got kids .
so , my wife , i got the children .
and therefore i was actually , clearly that it 's ] is that , this <unk> to take care .
and to some of one day , when she said , honey , it 's <unk> .
and now you go down .
yes , <unk> .
because i opened the door and then i was sitting there 's basically in this <unk> , whoa , i felt <unk> in the <unk> .
this was just like , how it back , we looked .

and when i then the teacher , say , i heard , and you know , the ones learn not for the school , but for a 's live there <unk> ' i , my god , the sentence 'em , i mean time , not <unk> .
what is that , what we from the school , from this school , for a 's life actually picked up to have ?
so many of us have <unk> there really good study .
where they actually in your life <unk> ever really good need to ?
and you may have some yet , like the capital from yugoslavia means .
what 's also again in yugoslavia ?
or <unk> , that capacity in short time amount of knowledge in the <unk> , just , so i do it then on a button again <unk> able to me that 's going ?
well , i got 'em , that time needed for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what is a <unk> from one point b to go out whether someone once a good doctor 's going ?
if the empathic , is , and if the good and diagnostic properties have ?
no way .
so , no way , for a 's life , not for the school , we learn .
if we so much envy , like <unk> years , the middle of <unk> century , like that yes , you voted .
this is the time , in germany , the <unk> then some point entirely was introduced .
and where we also the school , it today , its roots .
and if we wanted to go back to imagine then it was actually so , the people then the had no access to know their time .
and there were these four or six years , they 're kind of forced by , the school to go and with knowledge is crammed were that were then actually the only way , who had to do with the knowledge and the facts and the information their time in touch them to come .
now has a <unk> more information in his pocket and as the library of <unk> time .
and the middle of <unk> century , that was the time the industrialization .
that go out there , some changes in the world and there were suddenly people who needs of these new machines to serve as we could .
while being , but also people who needs of these machines to wait , and repair it could .
and we need people that these machines to construct it could and that these factories <unk> .
maybe you see it .
this <unk> school system that we now in germany in many of what they 're still have , has its root in this time .
and it 's potentially make sense .
well , because it was probably really that was that , what i in school because i learned 'em , for the work on the assembly , well , who at the assembly line standing , the state that a life .
we do <unk> looked into the future .
that to <unk> century , where it is , and we go to this year <unk> .
this year <unk> was this year , there was the first <unk> just close to pop .
i was with my studies done , and i thought , now is the point , now you doing your mobile apps , the first company .
yes , after some of them to me around , so with the internet , then <unk> ' i do , <unk> ' i think that now , this time .
and some corporations are at us <unk> and they were getting bigger and getting bigger , and we 're so beautiful slow grown , and some of the companies are then at us again , so in free fall <unk> .
you see , two times in life .
and we then after a few years , solid hours of staff .
so , we had such a wonderful growth and we had so exciting profession anywhere on board , like <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know , if you ai n't valued concrete have a democracy , what these people do , but when i the school was we had no idea that 's so what would be successful .
even when i <unk> did was from so what 's like the internet , not talking about .
and the kids that we now in the primary schooling . what good job to the in 10 to fifteen days , and twenty or 30 years have ?
the only honest answer <unk> we have no idea .
and what you know , what data are the need to in these better educate to doing ?
and if you 're honest , well , the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we degrees , so in the future , who could give me because the <unk> for the saturday , give .
there <unk> the golden ticket to get 'em , i read .
well , you see , they have no idea .
how we can get it comes out what to school for a 's lives learning how you ?
so what are things that we need to kids for a 's life , mentally stimulated to do ?
and maybe help , such a peek into in this , what companies today of employees to look .
that are very well , the <unk> from school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools and the universities are coming then in the company .
and if you like this ai n't traditional , <unk> look , and then it says , at first place , so what the expertise .
because i want . yes , so the reading , so , which we 're <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years <unk> and this traveled 12 years in corporate disclosure .
this is going to school right now , and also in the future ca n't afford .

and that you can basically , in three different groups to summarize .
this is , to do n't want in the staff , the scalable , are , flexibility in is a .
then you want to almost all their employees with .
and then you want to this kind of staff , the <unk> .
so we flexibility and entrepreneurial think and <unk> .
we start with the flexibility .
this is relatively quickly by understanding .
if we look at the economy to work , how fast , yes , how fast , everything is changing .
<unk> , yes , the whole business models are by the internet of today , the morning on the turned them .
there practice , `` i staff , with these changes can deal .
there practice , `` i staff , who are creative .
there practice , `` i staff , the <unk> .
this is quite the exact opposite of what in the factory , the end of <unk> century of collaborators at the assembly in place .
well , the second subject of the entrepreneurial think is fairly obvious .
because you go around the responsibility .
because you go to people to take responsibility .
first , and their own life .
but also for this .
if this now , the company is , or even when society , wishing that we people who take responsibility for this .
and the third factor , the <unk> that 's almost the most closely <unk> .
and if we wanted to soccer cup , remember , then there 's it 's the internet for this beautiful saying .
argentina , <unk> <unk> portugal , <unk> and germany has a team .
it was n't naíma <unk> the world cup you have made .
that were able to the only in common to create .
and also retain somebody like , this big energy innovator -- our time , steve jobs , yes , <unk> .
it was not the , the iphone , have invented , has not the <unk> invented , it about itunes n't invented , did n't know about being reinvented .
the had a team that made this possible , because just as a group were able to do that what they 've done .
so this ai at school , these three things are ways that , the phone , ai at school , we for a 's lives learning .
but there 's <unk> fourth thing and the is me almost more important .
and this is the learner himself .
if the only going to the future with security to say it is that it into uncertainty is then it 's the ability , and new to learn and fun doing to have this learning to see the <unk> that we in you later life , and that our children in the future earnings lives are succeeding .
the phone , but this ai at school , these things that tells them .
but where i was ?
i sat in this <unk> and the rest of them , the kids have to know that 's not like this ai event is , for the you <unk> have to pay .
so this ai event for the slogan of all it said , but not yet from each other .
to the point , where <unk> get elected , there are then suddenly all the invisible .
yes , i was sitting there and what should i say , <unk> one of my kids were these <unk> , the funniest parts of the event .
less fun , it was for me as a parent , if you like the stress around the subject of homework and learn the entire <unk> <unk> .
and even less fun makes it , when the kid was sick staff is , because in school more stressed out there .

in fact , it was also not <unk> , it was like a <unk> , so immediately after the last one hour and in fact , we were also the single parents , who were invited .
and i <unk> `` you now , and also told me the details <unk> after the point was clear , we need to our child , because the pointer that 's not .
<unk> are , but two years , in which we <unk> have given that works , whatever -- not .
what do n't really wrong ?
and we 'd actually the question is our child , fail ?
and we are the only , where it 's ?
now 'em , i in the last two years , since i put in the subject i studied with very many people who spoke and 'em , i discovered , no way i got 'em just learned , you 're not alone .

and what should i say , he got me almost the same story with his kids , it almost the same is construed as we , and that we had been fortunate that we our children 's <unk> able to figure out of the school , yeah ?
in berlin , there 's one , it ai <unk> at different schools and we could actually , charter into account .
but can that anyone out there are doing ?
somehow was us that too little , just our children in safety to bring together and grievances out there be like to leave society , they are .
and after we 're both now the sensation having to school , since we were there 's not that really. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

just , how shall we as <unk> there anything to change ?
the good thing is that we be fooled .
we 're not alone .
but we have a relatively fast this ai whole series of great people found that what used to how we , ai n't manage to create that all <unk> agreed to be .
it is yes , not so that 's the children and their parents lying under the suffering , which turns out there 's often happens .
if we the teachers to look , 30 percent of the teachers have <unk> .
if we look , the number <unk> in the last decade has changed the , doubled .
it can now be that all parents , which is going wrong ?
that all children had broken we 're and that , those teachers broken we are ?
or it be that we have a school , that simply no longer as valid , like this <unk> ago <unk> years , the fit just as well , so right .
and we have many people found , where it gets that went and we even people found that are not have children .
and they 've understood that you take responsibility to the future that you take responsibility to the future , by you take responsibility for that , our children and the kids , now the school , going to hang on the way to give .
and we sat on <unk> second point <unk> there are out there ai whole series of great initiatives , the school to change want , and there 's <unk> schools , here and there really cool thing <unk> and there 's almost any one of school teachers that are really involved , are and to change want .
and there 's even the one or bold principal , the eden , also <unk> the first step to go .
and how we should now as <unk> help ?
we know , no concept is , because now about helping us could .
but we can think one of doing , we can in those schools to go and we can in these schools in the people to school at the mind , so the parents , the teachers and the students , together and we can with are in two days , ai whole bunch of go .
there are so people together , in the past , like , against each have worked and the learning in two days , what it together to work .
that come with <unk> all the concrete challenge of them together to solve .
and after two things like the days have the then for example of a new <unk> up or the <unk> given for this ai n't totally new to high as we 're in berlin school right along behind .
or the have real action to <unk> problems that they do in your school have to grow up .
inside of two days you 've developed new approaches , the next day up every middle-class unit can get .
but what the most fabulous thing is , which of these two days happens , and that makes it for me , so beautiful , the small weekends , i got 'em , then also look at school in all of germany to spend , is that energy , because it arises when the three things to learn .
if the three things together to experience , so what the flexibility <unk> .
so sort of entrepreneurial think and if you as a team to experience .
then that is such a spark that <unk> .
and if we are four weeks after such <unk> workshop , so this ai n't get back then you know , we 're going to the school as a whole started , to change that there ai n't totally new culture has formed .
and that 's hot .
and i <unk> ' they 'll invite you rephrase the school to think .
i <unk> ' they 'll invite men , about education was thinking .
and i <unk> ' she was mostly also invited to about , of school , to talk .
you 're talking about this , what you like , but you 're talking also that , what you do n't like .
they will be surprised , how much <unk> you get and how many people can the have experienced , but just not talking about .
now , let , let 's every school in germany to <unk> century out .
now , let 's all of education system to change .
and now , let 's done together with the people to school day for the day off , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because it together we can do this .
thank you .
