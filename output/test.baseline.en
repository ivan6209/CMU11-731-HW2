when steve lopez , tech columnist the los angeles times , one day , the streets in the center of los angeles , i went , he heard a beautiful music .
they came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , rough , 31 , on a violin and playing , the only still two strings .
many of you 're going to the story that you know , because of <unk> article about it was later a book , that produces a movie was , robert <unk> junior varsity when steve lopez , jamie <unk> as nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> , the most <unk> school , and by promising career tragically the early age of <unk> schizophrenia , was ended .

i recommend you all , <unk> book to read or , the film and watch , so they 're not just the wonderful connected to understand that between these two men evolved is , but also , like the music with this is reconnect involving and how they finally this instrument was , if this pun and allows is that <unk> , nathaniel away from the road to get .
i met this mr <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a performance of <unk> first , and <unk> symphony of and i got behind the stage , out for me to imagine .

we got more environmental issue of music to talk . and a few days later i get an email , in the state that nathaniel , <unk> at my interest .
i have even mention that nathaniel a medical <unk> , because he was already with <unk> and with <unk> and <unk> been treated , a trauma , that his life that tracks .

and in precisely such a <unk> software , nathaniel , let the first to class , walt disney <unk> hall were beginning . he had this wrong about the flickering in their eyes , and this seemed completely lost .
he talked about the invisible , demons and smoke and of how i did anyone in their sleep and poison and i want .
i was afraid , governance , but i was afraid that i would otherwise might notice that it in a his earliest stages , sinking could , and that i tell your relationship to a violin at destroying it could , when i started , about <unk> and <unk> and other interesting shape the <unk> <unk> to talk .
i started so easy , to play .
i was playing the first set of <unk> <unk> .


<unk> <unk> rage and turning to in understanding , in a quiet for curiosity and immensity .
and the way through a miracle , he took his violin and started , after the ears in some clips from <unk> to play and asked me then , you to end to play : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started then , about music to talk , starting from the stream of beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , of <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he 's not just a <unk> know about music , i owned , but it with her as a tight personal relationship connected .
he spoke of her with a passion and an understanding that i would just by my colleagues in philharmonic of los angeles to know .
by his music playing and about music , talking , was out of this <unk> , confused man that 's still the streets of los angeles moved there was , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> <unk> musicians have .
music is medicine . music is transforming ourselves .
for nathaniel means that music <unk> health .
because the music , it allows him , his thoughts and intractable delusions and with his imagination and creativity in a real <unk> .
and so <unk> his agonized situations .
i realized that 's what is the essence of art is .
what this is the reason that we do n't listen to do : so we do something that in all of us , whilst in the inside there , our feelings , by our artistic lens , through our creativity to actually shape can .
and the fact , or the expression of reaching us , and moves , sparking off and it unites us .
what nathaniel <unk> , it took him the music back into a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music took him back into a family of musicians , it tends to be a talent and realized , and it <unk> .

thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play , that i <unk> the <unk> stolen .
i hope that they excuse me .
so i have in my life , many fishes known .
i only two very popular .
this first , this was more like a passionate <unk> .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good <unk> , <unk> , a best-selling book on the menu .
what a fish .

you could make , so i feel about that , it to sell it .
i had with this beauty of a sense of several months .
one day , called the head of the company , and said , if i at an event , poetry could about the sustainability in the farm .
`` course , '' i said .
there was a company , to solve was trying to what that unimaginable human problem , for chefs 's gone . how do n't tell us a fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we the ocean , helicopters , how we forests <unk> beat them .
it 's hard to the destruction , <unk> .
ninety percent of the big fish , that we love , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , this swordfish , they have collapsed .
it 's almost nothing more coming .
so it may or bad <unk> , <unk> , a piece of our future .
many of arguments against . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , we take these tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that means , 15 pounds <unk> are required to you a pound <unk> get .
not very sustainable .
it tastes , not very good .
so here was finally one company , trying to it right to do .
i wanted they supported .
the day before the event , i called the head of <unk> for the company .
we call him , don .
`` don '' , i said , `` just about the aggregate them to have , you are famous for , so far out in the sea of flood , you to the environment is not being polluted water . ''
`` this is true , '' he said , `` we 're so far out that the waste from fish are scattered all going to do n't quite concentrated . ''

this <unk> of <unk> to one , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one of what ? what she feeds on her ? ''
`` sustainable energy protein , '' he said .
`` awesome '' , i said . put on .
and at that night , i was in bed , i thought , what the hell 's a sustainable protein that ?
so i called the next day , before the event , don .
i said , don , which for example are sustainable energy protein ? ''
he said , he would panic that 's not . he 'll ask folks .

we call him as well , don .
`` don '' , i said , `` what for example are sustainable energy protein ? ''
now , he mentioned , some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , feathers to the skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and to get food processing . ''
i said , `` how much percent <unk> , is chicken ? `` well ,
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
`` well , that are about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , don , which is unsustainable , as a chicken at the fish to feed ? ''
there was a long as an intermission in the line and he said , `` there 's just too chicken , the world . ''
i <unk> me , from this fish .
no , not , because i was a <unk> <unk> and <unk> am .
that i 'm actually .
no , i <unk> fact , from this fish <unk> , because , i swear to god , the fish to this entertainment , for chicken <unk> .
this piece of fish , that 's a different kind of <unk> .
it 's the romantic sort of the kind of you , ever better if you put his fish even know , learns , you the fish in the more love .
i told him , in a restaurant in <unk> eaten .
a <unk> journalist who had been thinking about this fish even talk .
it gives us to pay <unk> .
he came on the table with a light , almost <unk> white color .
the chef who did <unk> .
jesus , twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can see a fish and so well , and taste , me , after he <unk> was ?
i ca n't it , but this guy is it .
we call him miguel sokoloff . actually means he says jose miguel sokoloff .
and no , he has the fish , cooked , and he 's not a chef . at least on the kind of them and i include not understand .
he 's a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner <unk> .
it 's near the <unk> of the river <unk> .
up in the 1980s , was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they <unk> <unk> on , which effectively , in wetlands , were .
they made this , by the country <unk> .
they built this complicated series of waterways , and they had urged her water from the country , and out into the river .
now , they could n't do that was working , not forwards economically .
and ecologically and it was a catastrophe .
it was roughly 90 percent of birds to , which for this place , many birds are .
and so , 1982 , a spanish company with green bought that land .
what they 're doing ?
they have the river of water around .
they 've literally the learnings turn-by-turn directions .
instead of the water <unk> used them the metalworkers , to the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a 11,000 components of acres <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , the shrimp , reclusive eel that -- and have miguel , and his company in the environmental destruction , completely subverted .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they have something that have never seen .
you stare out on the horizon , a million miles away is , and everything what you 're <unk> channels and this dense , lush march .
i was there was n't long time with miguel sokoloff .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts by charles darwin and a part , `` a crocodile , kissing . ''

here , picks it 's a rare <unk> forth .
now upon it 's the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here 's a pattern of the pool , that it on the <unk> giraffe , remember .
it turns out that is miguel most of his career in <unk> park in africa has spent .
i asked him , and it to such a <unk> 's gone .
he said , `` the fish ? i know anything about the fish .
i 'm an expert , for connection . ''
and then he comes and fall in the more <unk> of those rare in the birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and understand it does n't like me wrong , this was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak force of this <unk> a few factoids for the fish that i 'm at <unk> had .
so i put him at random . i said , `` miguel , how it comes to your fish and so well , tastes like ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , of phytoplankton , the relationships , it 's unbelievable .
but what we eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
now , he goes on me to tell that 's such a <unk> system is that the fishes better food , what you in the wild eat them .
the more vegetable biomass , and phytoplankton , the <unk> , that 's what the fish , manufacture .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
it 's no food .
the more of a farm heard of your animal does n't actually manufacture goods ?
later , the day i drove up this site , is miguel around and i asked him , i said , `` for a place , so needless to shine '' , different than any of farm , the i ever been , `` how to measure , you are succeeding ? ''
in the moment , it was , as if a <unk> a <unk> order to have .
and we bent around the corner and we provided by the most incredible sight , thousands and pinker flamingos , a literally , pinker carpet and so far from the eye is grounded .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look , you , their bellies on , pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was really confused .
i said , `` miguel , <unk> they do n't find your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we 're lost 20 percent of our fish and <unk> at the birds .
now , last year we were on this site 600,000 , birds , more than 250,000 ways .
it 's going out of the largest and one of the key to private <unk> all of europe has gone .
i said , `` miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last thing that is on a <unk> have to ? ''
he shook his head , no .
he said , `` we build <unk> , not heavily .
this is a <unk> network .
the flamingos , and eat the shrimp .
the shrimp , and eat the phytoplankton .
ever , pinker looks so the stomach , better , the system . ''
okay , now , let 's to revisit . a farm , your animal does n't actually manufacture and a farm , their success of the health of its predators on measuring .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and the way to these flamingos covered by <unk> n't even be there .
they found breeding pushed into city of the 240 million miles away , where the <unk> better , it 's <unk> .
every morning to fly it comes 240 million miles to farm .
and every night fly it comes 240 million miles back .
they do that because they the <unk> white line the highway <unk> are you can .
seriously .
i had a trip across the penguins had presented factually , so i went miguel sokoloff .
i said , `` miguel , fly it comes 240 million miles to the farm and fly them up 240 million miles back at night ?
they do that for the children ? ''
he looked at me , when i just a song from the whitney , and houston , quotes .
he said , `` no . they do that because the food is better . ''
i 'm not the capability of my beloved fish and said , the most delicious was , and i do n't like <unk> . i ca n't you <unk> . i ca n't you <unk> .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i 'm cooking , almost never seen it .
and yet , when i told them in this restaurant in <unk> try 've got it does n't even after <unk> <unk> .
she liked the sweet and pure , as if you a half bites by the ocean , i’m going .
i mentioned the visceral is miguel , and he <unk> .
he said , `` the skin that looks like a sponge .
it is the last <unk> , until something in the body to entry .
you , over the evolution has evolved to <unk> <unk> . ''

okay . a farm , your fish do n't actually manufacture . a farm , their success is measuring the success of its predators .
and then i was clear , if he says , a farm , no <unk> , <unk> it sounds powerful , because the water , this is through this farm flows from the river <unk> spray .
it 's a river , all the things , leads , which are rivers , today to pitch , you , to lead , chemical pollutants , drain , <unk> .
and if it , through the system , fought , and this leaves is the waters clean , how it <unk> is .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm , their animals not apple feeds , not just a farm , their success of the health of its predators , measures , but a farm , literally a <unk> is , and not just for these fish , but also for you and me .
because if the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i took him , and that they to do too , because these <unk> , romantic , whatever , is also <unk> .
you might argue that she 's a recipe is the future of good food , if we of <unk> or <unk> talk .
what we now we need , is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the foods really good , delicious .
but for many people 's a little too radical .
we 're not <unk> , we <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we 're talking about local food . we eat the organic .
and if they claim that the things are the future of good food can assure everybody says , somebody somewhere on and says , `` hey guys , i love the pink flamingos , but how they will feed the world ?
how they will feed the world ? ''
i must be honest ?
i like this question is not .
no , not , because we have enough calories are producing the world more than just to feed .
one billion people are going to starve .
one billion -- which is more than ever -- because <unk> inequalities , in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i like this question is not , because it 's the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years of overheating .
grows grain of <unk> , <unk> to know monocultures , chemicals at the earth , chicken at the fish , and all the time has to agribusiness , just wondered : `` if we more people 's cheaper to feed , how awful it 's being ? ''

we should they say , what it is , a <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> , that fast <unk> capital , eats , and that this production of today .
this is not <unk> , and it is n't agriculture .
our <unk> today is a threatened , not because <unk> <unk> , because <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , it by a fertile one country , not by the pumps , but through fresh water , not of chainsaws , it by making forests , and not by any boats , and networks , it by the fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
now , let 's start with the question : how we going to feed itself ?
or better , how do we conditions do that every community , enabling to yourself to feed ?
to bring that do , look not on the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and ever-faster machines are at <unk> and it has ever sees something really good for food produced .
let me behind the ecological systems model .

they looking miguel , farmers like miguel ,
businesses that are not worlds , are , businesses that restore , instead <unk> , businesses , the <unk> grow rather than just hard to farmers , not just to atmosphere-altering gases are , but experts , for connection ,
because they are the ones that experts to flavor .
and when i really honestly , they 're a better version of subtracting things when i do it ever be going .
so you know that 's me , right , because if that the future of good food is , it 's delicious .
thank you .
if i give you today , one thing <unk> want it 's the <unk> the data that we consume that 's bigger than the sum of bits and instead to <unk> to think i want to you think about how we information that can use to patterns that you have and we like trends to realize that otherwise , not visible , has gone .
so , what we see here 's a typical <unk> to age , arranged .
this program that i 'm here to use , is a little experiment .
it means <unk> and what i do with <unk> can do this is that i after a certain common cause to filter it , we say , accidents .
and instantly i see a different patterns that they 're going out .
and that he said , because in <unk> here in the people at <unk> are and it over here at <unk> .

so if we go further and after the age <unk> , we say , 40 years or a younger , we see that crashes drop in the leading is about the do people are going to do .
and who <unk> see that is especially for men in true .
you see so that 's look of information and data in this is how much of swimming in a <unk> <unk> reminds us .
and if we do this for raw data can make , why do n't even for the content of itself ?
what we now have here are the <unk> every single , `` the sport <unk> '' that ever in print .
it 's all right here . it 's everything online .
it can actually like to my talk in their rooms and test .
with <unk> can you delve into a decade .
you can jump into a particular year .
you can be related to a certain copy of the pearls .
now if i here , i look , i see the athletes , in this copy of stuff , and the sports .
i 'm a lance armstrong 's a fan , so i click bombers could tie to me all expenses that show in which have lance armstrong mentioned will .
now , when i just a <unk> tour of getting to be that i think , `` ok , what if i do with the subject i 'm cycling , looking at you ? ''
so i walk a step back and <unk> of view .
now i 'll be greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea that what if you this information scans , <unk> , broadly , <unk> , <unk> , looking for you do n't or <unk> not just .
you do something that actually a little differently .
it 's something between , and we think it 's changing the way of how information can be .
i 'd like this idea now a little further and execute it has sort of what a little crazy .
what here we 've done is , we have any <unk> taken and it on a little summary , reduced .

i 'm just take the top , 500 of <unk> <unk> .
but even in unconstrained view , we can get lots of things .
now we get a sense of the issues , on wikipedia , at <unk> .
i 'm going to the issue <unk> ' choice .
now , after i <unk> `` elected , i know what i feel that the <unk> , most likely to reveal behavioral time <unk> `` people of the year . ''
this is really important , because this is an insight is that are not in a single <unk> there .

overlooking on a certain that <unk> i can then in the subject of time <unk> `` people of the year , '' go , and all together .
now if i all these people consider you know what i feel that the majority of <unk> . some of coming out of science . some , less again , come from the economy . it 's my head . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , is a bono 's also a ted prize winner .
so we can now fast forward and one look at all the ted prize winner and throw away .
you see , we are browsing the web of the first time as if it also really a net is , not just by side to , but more abstractly .
and so i want you what else to show what a little surprise be .
i 'll show you is just the new york times website .
<unk> , this app -- i want it 's not a browser , as space ; it 's not a browser , but you can websites to look -- and we bring these <unk> to each blog how this .

this is why most important , because you just through that look at the web pages into this way of , all the <unk> the same way of you can .
so i can not in my trajectory zoom in a certain <unk> .
here is the state of all the demonstration , i until the surface combatants 've given .
and i can sort everything , what i 'd have been considered 've , again , we jump-start along .
and , when i do another one step <unk> and on all look , can i happened to mandate , maybe for my <unk> . here , i have to <unk> ' bateson , here , bing , right here to live from labs <unk> .
and of this is , i in the side of the edge , and it again <unk> .
it 's a metaphor that kept being used , and every time , it does this picture than the sum of the <unk> .
the moment , in this world , we think that 's a curse .
we talk from the curse of <unk> .
we talk from `` drowning in information . ''
what if we this situation to turn up and the internet on the head to ask , so that we instead , from going to the other to go to start by many things too many things go to , and this pattern recognition , which venture race has remained , be ?
if we do that can do , it 's this <unk> <unk> , maybe a new sources of urgency of information .
and , instead , just in information to move to do you know it to get .
and if we know about , then we can possibly even <unk> make them .
so i hear on , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> <unk> science fiction made up .
in my school , i drove up the bus to school , every day an hour a route .
and my nose , apparently , in a book , a <unk> , that my mind in other worlds <unk> and on <unk> way that i feel deep in me that blogging , voracious , curiosity <unk> .
this exploration turns out , at that i always , when i 'm not in school was , through the forests <unk> , walked and `` blood samples . '' which collected , frogs and snakes and bugs , and <unk> , everything for home spot , and under the microscope he looked at .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it went out there was always around the trial , the world to understand and the limits of sorts of explore .
and my love to science fiction , it seemed to in my neighborhood picture , because the time , in the late '60s , we went to the moon and exploring the deep ocean .
jacques cousteau came in our living with his fascinating . shows that we animals and places and a world of wonders they showed that we 'd never had to present .
that it may be pretty good to enable <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's no video games , these <unk> with computer-generated performance of movies , all the brush in the landscape , i had the images in my head of technology .
that we had to be at all . if we as children 's a book read , we entered the description of <unk> and projected that they look at the screen in our minds .
my response to it was that sketching and paint by aliens , alien worlds , robots , <unk> and all so what .
in the x-files , i was constantly through from teachers get it , like me , the backyard textbook was hidden , <unk> .
the creativity has to hold a way out .
and what happened is something interesting . what i 'm going to jacques <unk> shows that fascinated was the idea of us to be completely unknown , the world here on our planet itself .
certainly would i mean , never an alien world with a spacecraft to achieve . this seemed to me very unlikely .
but there was a world , i actually ever been able to see here on earth , and she was also fascinating and more exotic as all that , what i always had imagined , when i those books had read .
so i decided , when i was 15 , scuba divers , to be .
the only problem that was me to go into a tiny village in canada , living , 1,000 kilometers from the next ocean away .
of me to do n't <unk> .
i kind of my father , it until finally , a <unk> in the shittiest climate , new york , participants had made , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> right in winter , in the shittiest climate , new york .
the ocean , but , a real , the ocean , i got only two years later to face , when we used to california moved .
since , in the 40 years , the meantime <unk> are , i spent about 3,000 hours on underwater spent . 300 hours of them in <unk> .
and i 've learned that the world , the deep , even in the <unk> oceans , so rich , <unk> life is how to let 's really hard to present .
to imagination of nature knows , no boundary , in contrast to our own , <unk> human imagination .
to the present day or an obligation , i just utter awe of this , what i have on my <unk> see .
and my love to the ocean does , with the same intensity as jesus , and ever .
when i then as an adult encountering a profession <unk> , it was the <unk> .
this seemed the best way of my inner drive , stories to tell , with my desire , images to create , to unite .
as a kid who drew me constantly <unk> and so .
so we were making films that the road , images and stories <unk> . that fit together .

on `` <unk> '' i became my preference for the <unk> and that dip to the <unk> together .
so intertwined , sort of my two passions .
you see something happened on `` <unk> '' : to a <unk> problem in this video to solve -- and that we had such a kind of liquid <unk> create -- that cracked down to the computer-generated animation , <unk> , back .
what we came , was the first computer-generated <unk> , ever in a film to see here .

he says arthur clarke 's law , they were confined <unk> technology and magic , each other to discriminate .
they were so something magic .
and that i thought was incredibly exciting .
and i said , `` wow , this must have in the cinematic be involved . ''
so we went into `` the terminator , two , '' my next movie , even more on .

and it worked . again , we had something magic is created . and the effect in the audience was the same . '' now we have to the film have a little bit more money <unk> .
of these two experiences mesopotamia , was a whole new world development goal , a whole new world of creativity to <unk> .
so i founded a company , with my good friend with stan winston , the time , the best <unk> and <unk> was . they called `` the digital <unk> . ''
the core of the company was it , the stage <unk> processes with visual <unk> etc . to skip the same with digital <unk> to start .
that we did , and <unk> us as a while a competitive .
but the '90s , we realized that we , we in <unk> and <unk> -- what we the company , actually started having -- to slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` computational avatar . '' written , that the <unk> in terms of visual effects and <unk> effects in the whole new heights say it should , realistic human , expressive characters , using <unk> made with were . and the <unk> should all <unk> be . and the world would <unk> be .
but the <unk> <unk> stuff back . and the people in my company that told me that we <unk> not yet the capacity to say , that to create .
so , shifted , and made this other film about the big ship , that rose .
the <unk> i think that as `` romeo and juliet on a ship . '' he sells . it was a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a passionate about film .
those secretly , but i wanted to actually , for real wreckage of the titanic to immerse ourselves .
why i the movie .
this is the truth . the studio , i knew that , but not .
i have it , but somehow , by i said , `` we come to the wreckage . we shoot the real wreckage .
we get it in the <unk> of the movie .

and i <unk> you , an expedition to finance .
sounds crazy . but that goes back to come back to own imagination a reality rendering it .
we then created in fact , six months after a reality , i 'm in russian <unk> thrust , four kilometers of the surface of the atlantic , and i from the real titanic , through a <unk> <unk> .
this was not a movie , no <unk> , that was real .
so that i really got that blew .
and the preparation for that were enormous . we had camera and a spotlight , and everything you can build .
and i fell on , how much of these <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you will increase in that cramped capsule , floating market , in this dark , hostile environment , down , where no hope , saving is , it does n't even back does .
and i said , `` wow , that 's just as well , as if i 'm in <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was literally are possessed by studying the deep .
presumably from the part , with curiosity and science to do it . it was it . it was an adventure , it was a curiosity . it was an imagination .
and it was an experience that i from hollywood 's not be able to .

in on the following expeditions i being in <unk> seen , and sometimes these things that i 'll never seen before had , sometimes even things that have n't seen previously had and for that science to point , when we do you saw , yet , no words , he had found .
this , i was so right <unk> , and i wanted more .
and so i then a something unusual decision .
after the success of `` titanic '' i told me , `` okay , i want to my <unk> as a filmmaker , in hollywood on the melting down and i 'm going to a while <unk> . ''
and we then , we were diving , `` <unk> '' , and they were exploring with <unk> .

we took the little robot that we were building , a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> , the inside of the ship to watch , which never did n't been .
nobody had ever that inside of <unk> demands . you 'd still no means that . so we evolved to generate any technology .
well , let me sit well , the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> that these <unk> here 's very similar , and of which i know that once the band , there was playing .
and i fly with a <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i of shopping it 's just really , but my mind is inside the <unk> .
it felt , when i 'd be physical spaces inside the <unk> the titanic snail .
that was the <unk> form of <unk> , i ever 've experienced , because before i each of a corner on international , i knew i always , what does in <unk> of <unk> show you 'd given that i <unk> getting <unk> been running , when we the film and turned out .
the instructions , i was , which is an exact replica of <unk> of the ship .
so this was a highly strange and experience .
they made me this <unk> realized that you add <unk> avatars are using and so that own consciousness in the car , in this different form of existence embarrassed you can .
it was really quite profound
and maybe a brief act on that which may be in a few decades could happen , if you <unk> has to work to explore , or other things to do , in all sorts <unk> <unk> , i as <unk> can imagine .
for these kinds of expeditions we started this , down there 'd seen , really appreciate to learn , for example , these <unk> , where we these incredible <unk> right whales saw . that are sort of the aliens , but here on earth .
they live with all by <unk> .
they are not in the sunlight <unk> system , how we do that .
and so you see animals , the next one of 300 degrees are called them to survive there can .
the same time interest , i also very much for <unk> , that was once in the <unk> from my childhood .
and so i ended up at the people , the space that interest and with the nasa harnesses to have and in <unk> sit and the right <unk> plan . they go to russia , through periods of the mission that <unk> protocol telephony , all its bells and to fly and then the international <unk> and take our <unk> with .
this was fascinating .
but at all rolled it out that i <unk> with us in the deep took .
i pulled them , and <unk> you access to the world 's down there : <unk> , <unk> , people , for such extreme conditions interested . i pulled them to the vents in this , so you look around , sample and instruments to evaluate how could and so forth .
we turned out that documentaries , powered , but actually visualize science , specifically , <unk> .
so lock into the circle anywhere from my existence as <unk> , then as a kid , and the execution in the reality .
in the course of likelihood -- i have a lot of learning .
i have a lot of science entirely . but i 'm thinking , you probably , a director does it can lead to a leader be like a <unk> or so .
i understood , but not a lot of leadership , before i this ocean expeditions <unk> .
because of a particular point i had to tell me , `` what i do is actually here ?
why i doing this ? what comes out ? ''
these stinking films to bring us no money .
we 'll look at the caused a . of fame -- not a lane .
all think , i was between the `` titanic '' and `` computational avatar . '' <unk> and i 'd let me to be some of nails it on a towel that the beach <unk> .
i 've all these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
not a fame , not honor , no money . what you doing it ?
you 're doing it to the task will to the challenge will -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment , there . you 're doing it of <unk> because , and because of funny connection that comes to a small group of people have a team up forming .
because we have all this with only 10 to 12 people did that many years , non-stop 've been collaborating with . sometimes we were to two , three months row , at sea .
and in this community you see that the most important thing to be aware is that you 're going to each other , because you a task to overcome it that anybody else can explain .
if you on land revert back and they say , `` we had to do it , this fiberglass , the <unk> , and this very vague , the whole technology , and the trouble , the human <unk> , if you look at sea , work , '' then you do that other just do n't explain . this is the police or at the soldiers , something together we have gone through and you know that it 's never discriminated can explain .
there is a connection , a contradiction of respect .
when i so back to my next film `` computational avatar . '' to turn , i tried to the same failures to apply , which is that you his team have respected and , in return of respect , deserves .
it was the dynamic really changed .
because i stood so again with a small team on <unk> terrain . we turned `` computational avatar . '' with a new technique that it before , we did n't .
incredibly exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we were for a period of a half years to a real family .
it changed , my way , films to do , completely .
there were people , who said , we have these <unk> yes , really good <unk> and the planet pandora , the lumber .
for me , it was more a <unk> way , my job to do , the actual process to the result of that has changed .
what we can now , all the finish ?
some lessons we learned ?
i think , at first place is the curiosity .
it 's the most powerful human quality .
our imagination is a force , even a reality rendering it .
and the aware of your team is important than all <unk> this world .
come to me a young , filmmaker , `` give you me a council , i do this can . ''
and i say `` <unk> , do n't even a .
the boards , other for you . do it does n't get yourself , i bet you do n't want to yourself . it 's take risks on you . ''
the nasa has lifted such a <unk> `` failure is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and the study have failure is an alternative to be , because there , guarantees that 's a leap .
no big endeavor , this innovation is demanding , ever been without risk being addressed .
you must be willing to those risks on to take .
that 's the idea , i them to participate in the want to leave . failure is certainly an alternative , fear but it 's no . thanks .
now i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and the surprise , maybe something that , because my <unk> at the foundation , mostly around the vaccines , and seed is the things that we self-invent , and deliver need to the poorest two billion a better life to sustain .
but energy and varied climates are extremely important for those people , in fact , even more than for each other on planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> over many years , will grow . it we too much or to make some rain . the things going to this change , how it their fragile our environment that it could bear .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to the uncertainty . it leads to riots .

and it 's the <unk> for you very important .
the fact is that , if you just by one , the price down could , to <unk> would energy in a distance , most effective .
now , the <unk> is about the time , like .
actually based on the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> drive in the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century . there was a <unk> case in <unk> and why we refrigerators , <unk> , we can become modernity in materials for manufacture and so many things .
we are so in a wonderful situation with electricity in the wealthy world .
but , if we the price down -- let 's the price to half -- we 're hitting on a new boom and this barrier that goes along with carbon locked together .
co2 , warmed the planet and the equation for carbon is actually quite clear .

now , the exact same relationship between a <unk> and the frame of net <unk> and where the other road ahead , there 's some <unk> , but not a lot .
and there are certainly <unk> of how bad , these are outcomes . but they 're deeply unhappy being .
i have the <unk> several asked , `` we really need to come down on the near zero to come ?
do better than half of or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we 're near zero to come to the temperature 's going up .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have a 3.5 feet high office truck , in three feet a bridge from mortality . the then you can sort of fellow from <unk> .
this has quite oblivious to bottom , at zero .
now , we hit each year , a lot <unk> out , of 26 billion tons .
every american about 20 tons . people of the poor countries , less than one .
the average , there are about five million tons for everyone on planet .
and somehow we need to change , fulfilling this , that looked at zero to lower .
it 's been consistently gone .
just different economic transformations to have it even influence and we need of <unk> rise to a reduction go and to a reduction in the way on a zero .
that equation , has four factors . a little <unk> . they have this thing left -- carbon dioxide -- that you 're moving towards zero to break , and this is used by the number of people depend on , of the service , every man on average use , the average of energy for any service and the co2 , that per unit <unk> will .
now , let so every single factor of them individually look , and i think we , that the inherited over time .
probably needs of these numbers very close to zero to return .
now this is the basic algebra , but let 's time through .
initially we the population .
today life was 6.8 billion people ,

if we 're very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are we could that i think about 10 percent to 15 percent down , but , we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second thing that are the services , we use .
and that includes all , the food that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
that are very good things and <unk> mean , those services are virtually everyone on planet earth accessible to do .
it 's amazing that number drops .
in the wealthy world , in the top of a billion , we could possibly <unk> do and less energy efficient , but the average will this number of every year in fundraising , so collectively than double , the number of services , per person to be provided .
here we have a very basic services . there 's home , and light , so you the homework can read it ?
and those students have it , so what they go out and reading your schoolwork under the <unk> .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there 'll achieve good news .
we have something that 's not going up ,
because of success in <unk> , through the other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> , there are many human services , whose <unk> some of services to use to 90 percent decrease .
in any service , like the fabrication of <unk> , at 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> , is the scope for improvement is very much smaller .
and large , if we optimistic that are , we have this might be a reduction , to a factor , three or maybe to a factor of six .
but at the first three factors , we 're now of 26 billion , maybe <unk> 13 billion tons of gone . and that does n't been out !
so we 're so the fourth factor of -- and this is a x-factor in his -- this is the amount of co2 , per unit <unk> will .
it turns out the question , if you that the ground zero can get .
if you coal , burning , no .
if you gas will burn agriculture : no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> now , the co2 , except that renewables , and of .
so , what we were on a global level have to do , is , a new paradigm to create .
we need <unk> .
now if i the term `` wonders , '' i use , i 'm not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and whose human services is a miracle .
the people here have to the development of a lot of this miracle that contributed .
normally , there 's not a deadline , you a miracle to a date , needs .
normally think about how you can kind of only square and there are going to others not .
in this case , we need , but <unk> , and give a miracle in very long time .
now , i wondered , i can do this <unk> ?

i think back at last year , when i mosquitos to me and somehow i liked the people that .
the idea was for you really quite material , you know that there are there , to mosquitos to live .
for energy , i noticed this one .
i decided that <unk> of fireflies make my <unk> contribution to the environment , this would be .
here are so a natural or fireflies .
you have to me that insured that they do n't bite . in fact , they will probably wo n't even the glass , left .
now , there are all kinds <unk> like this , but they get all not much .
we need technological solutions , either one or a number one of unimaginable scale and unimaginable dependability . and although it many different directions , there , in which people to look for i do see just five , that cause of the needs can afford .
i have the tides , <unk> , the merger and better biofuels <unk> .
this way , maybe a plotted the contributions and if you better way as i expect , that would be great , but my second punch line here is that we all of those five have to work , and we ca n't of you give up , because they 're <unk> , because all have significant problems .
let 's first of the burning fossil fuels , burning of either of coal or gas .
what you go to have , it seems to be simple , but this is n't . you 'd all the co2 , that after the burning of the <unk> comes to capture , under pressure <unk> and then some place is stored and hope that there 's left .
there are some <unk> it on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level of creating , but it on 100 percent to be very difficult to be . and an agreement for the storage out of co2 to outcomes , is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who 's going to make sure ?
who can do assure that what 's literally hours a billion times bigger than any kind of waste , you fall of <unk> and other things we can imagine ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that 's a tough <unk> .
the next thing : of .

and what do you then with the garbage patch ?
because although he did n't it 's very large , there 's a lot of concerns .
so three really heavy problems that may be solvable are , and at which you to work should .
the last three of the five , i 've summarized why .
there are those renewables , how they often be called .
and also the have -- although it is great , you to make any fuel needs -- they have some downsides .
for one is the <unk> that these technologies create dramatic lower than the of <unk> .
that are <unk> , you talk from a lot <unk> , a thousand times more land , as a normal power station .

the sun shines , not the whole day , it seems too , not every day and it blows , the wind and not only thing .
so you have to having a set of these resources out depending on this is , a way to have to the energy , in times when they do is available , to get .
there are so big <unk> . there are challenges in the transmission . if we say that tell the source , outside of the country is , you do n't just the technology , and they need to the risk around the solar energy from where else comes from .
and there 's <unk> .
and the dimension to show , i 've all kinds of the batteries , who are made , looking , for cars , computers , phones , <unk> , for everything . and that i did with the amount of electronic energy , which the world 's consuming , comparing them . i found that all the batteries , we 're producing , less than 10 minutes of the <unk> storing up .
we need so here 's a big break , something that to a factor of 100 vastly better be that , as the approaches to the time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not that .
that happens , you 're trying to these <unk> sources of we say , 20 percent -- 30 percent of oh point to bring .
if you about 100 percent to sustain want to do you need an incredible <unk> .
now , where should we go : what 's the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project , '' ? how we come to the goal ?
what we need are many companies that are working . hundreds of .
in each of these five different areas we need at least 100 people .
in many you will say , who are hickory nuts . it 's good .
i think , here in the ted group there , where they 've been engaged .
bill are big has several different companies , among other one named <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies , the great things do and interesting ways to have and i try this to support .
nathan myhrvold and i pay for a company that , may surprise , the nuclear approach to follow .
there are some innovations in <unk> ; and modular , liquid .
the construction has in this industry while ago i stopped , so it 's no big surprise that some good ideas , lying .

that 's quite a crazy idea .
but actually did you know what 's been thinking , but you could never make reasonable behaviors , whether it would work , but since it modern supercomputer that there , do you simulate and see that : aye . with the right <unk> , it looks like that it <unk> .
and because you that 99 percent of burning , is that <unk> very much better .
actually burning , the garbage , and you can even the waste of connectivity these reactors operate as <unk> use .
instead , about the head to break , burn it 's easy . a great thing .
the low-enriched uranium is being incremental uses , a little bit like a candle that .
you see that 's a bar is , often as `` a traveling the wave of reactor . '' he calls .
that solves it 's <unk> .
here 's a picture of nowhere in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part , the beginning to burn it 's going to <unk> so it <unk> uranium .

and if you <unk> inexpensive and just <unk> , you get plenty of fuel for the rest of our lifetimes of the planet .
you know , there 's still many challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward to come .
think we , our success to measure things .
how should we have a testament to look ?
now , we go up to the goal , that we need and then we 're talking about the <unk> .
many talk from an 80 percent reduction , until 2050 .
it 's really important that we 're going to get .
the rest of 20 percent are in the poorest countries to be produced , and still something that agriculture . hope it <unk> and cement , until then clean his .
so , this around 80 percent to get to have the developed world , including the countries like china , their <unk> completely forbid .
the other note she says , if we the <unk> technology can use these organizations , in all the developed countries used is , and we the way are , you to the rest to get .
that 's great deal .
this is a <unk> this <unk> .
if we of go back , like that 2020 as testament to look ?
it was supposed to the two elements of contain .
we should the <unk> use to reduce the way to bring . ever , we <unk> , increasing with low is the <unk> be and so , the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things that we do that do n't fully to the big , <unk> lead , just a moment , or in fact that matter less as the other , which have to move fast of innovation for these amazing breakthroughs that represents .
this amazing breakthroughs , we need to <unk> track and that we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books to this topic .

they take it really , and create a framework , where this opened up discussing can be , because we need to support of all sides .
there 's a few things that come together .
this is a request .
a very <unk> desire to this technology making .
if you me just a wish for the next 50 years to allow , i could the president to choose , a vaccine , and that i love , i could this desire to vote , the message says , <unk> <unk> no carbon being reinvented . this desire for additional i .
this has the biggest impact .
if we have this desire to do n't get to make the dig in between the term , and short term , user , terrible to be between the united states and china , between the poor and the rich countries . and almost all of these two billion are very much worse .
what we need to do ?
for which measures <unk> i ?
we need for more <unk> use .
if countries , in places like <unk> meet , they should not only about carbon to talk .
they should those <unk> repeat , and they were shocked by the ridiculous , low <unk> , for that cutting-edge approaches to spend .

we need to spread the message .
we have real-time <unk> and full lead and also the things that of the government to be done .
it is a wish , but i think , we can see him meet .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thanks !
thank you . just about <unk> bit better to understand -- yeah , they can give us an idea of the scale that investment to be ?
bill gates : the simulation putting on a supercomputer to conduct , all the great scientist to get , what we 've done , we need a few of 10 million . and even if we our materials in a russian nuclear reactor tested have to ensure that 's reasonable that works , is you only in the <unk> million .
the tricky step is the building of the first <unk> , another billion to find , the <unk> and the place in fact , the first of building .
once the first case closed , he says it 's how i promised , everything is clearly , because the sense , the <unk> is so , unlike of the way we know it .

bg : right . now you have the reactor sits over again , regardless , so there are many people and many <unk> to go wrong can . this thing where you make it opens and things <unk> or <unk> . this is not good .
but when you very cheap fuel , the fudge factor for 60 years , regardless of -- you think about a column , they bury , without the whole <unk> .
and it 's sitting there , and <unk> for 60 years , and then it 's done .
a nuclear reactor , even a solution for the garbage may provide .
bg : yeah . now , what do with the junk that happens : you can see him sitting , let’s -- there are much less junk shot with this method -- then take it and grab him in the next reactor and burn it on .
and we start , by we the garbage can take that 's already exists , in these <unk> or <unk> at the reactor 's . this is our <unk> .
so this is , which for these reactors run a problem was that , in our fill and so that will <unk> dramatically reduce that during this process .
but while you with different people , this world of these choices we 've talked ,
where 's the interest , so what actually implement ?
bg : well we still not on a place in setting up and there 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear '' in the name is wearing . there are passion and the people of the company was in russia , india , china -- i was here and have the minister of diy and talked about , like this to <unk> matches .
i 'm optimistic . you know , and the french and japanese who have something in the direction .
this is a nuance , one thing that was done .
this is a crucial step forward , but it 's like a very quickly this reactor and some countries have this building , why is everybody , a rapid reactor was implemented , a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination , <unk> and the probability that really get involved in to shout out ?
bg : well , we need one of <unk> , <unk> things that are very inexpensive , are , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to use .
this is sort of the deadline , the <unk> has illustrated that we <unk> need .
and , you know , <unk> , if all walks , and that 's a big wants to be the light up .
and fortunately , there are today , dozens of companies , and that we needed hundreds of , as well , if those approaches worked , the funding for your pilots who works , for <unk> can .
and it would be the most if it 's a number of creating , because then you could be a mixture of overheating .
, we need a solution .
polls , the great possible to make breakthroughs , is this the biggest , that you know ?
bg : a <unk> is that of .
this is it even without the <unk> been , but that makes it so much more important .
in a nuclear sector , there are some innovative companies .
you know , we 've met whose job is not as good that , but there are modular way that 's a different approach .
there 's a fluid <unk> , which bit difficult it seems , but you might say that 's about us .
and so there are different , but this nice thing is that a <unk> a million times as much energy , as a , we say , a <unk> and therefore , if you with the problems can get around and they are mainly in the radiation , the footprint , and the cost , plays the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , in your own big league table .
if that does n't , what ?
we need <unk> i introduce to try to the <unk> stable enough to do ?
bg : if you in this situation where , it 's as if you ate too much , and about to attack . what do you then ? you need to be a <unk> or anything .
there 's a <unk> the , <unk> calls `` well , with various techniques , looking at the warming to delay , so we 20 or 30 years longer , expend around us <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you pray , that we do n't need .
some people say , you should n't start at the insurance will work , because you do that might be lazy , you can continue to eat , because you know that one of the <unk> save it .
i do n't know if that 's smart , you the importance of this problem front of that , but there are now a larger discourse in <unk> about , if you that 's available to have to , if the things rapidly go , or this innovation longer need , when we expect .
<unk> : you have a or two possible sentences for the to you may have to convince them ?
bg : well , unfortunately , in the skeptics in very different <unk> .
the ones scientific paper presenting to do , are very much .
they say that 's negative effect there , with the clouds to have to the things are shifting ?
there 's very , very few things that you even able to ask of whom it 's a chance in a million there .
this <unk> here 's like with aids .
you do is the mistake now , and you pay for much later .
and why is the idea , now , if you all kinds <unk> have issues , in something to invest in that you do n't until later , which has -- and to come to the investment is not that 's clear . actually is the ipcc report did n't exactly the worst case scenario , and there are people in the wealthy world , monarch butterfly could look and say , okay , that 's no big , drama .
the fact that is that uncertainty , we 're worried that should .
but my dream is that , it , economic can do , and the same time that carbon over , say , the skeptics , `` okay , it does n't interest me that 's no carbon <unk> , i desired cup of that it did that , but i 'm it would accept , because it 's cheaper than the previous one way . ''
and that would your answer on the <unk> lomborg comes the argument that , if you all this time and energy use to the co2 problem to solve , all the other goals to suffer , the <unk> , the fighting of malaria and so on that 's a stupid waste of resources to the money to invest , while it better flavors and there , we can do .
bg : well , the actual expenses for the research -- we say the u.s. to 10 billion per year , spend when they do today -- that 's not as dramatically .
beneath it should be other things do n't hurt .
you come up to big <unk> , and here we can make reasonable people disagree with , if you something , that 's not forwards economically , is , and trying to this to finance . for me is going on the most of waste .
it was because , you is really about to <unk> and financed , the curve . i think we should be more things are trying to the potential to have , very much cheaper to be .
if the <unk> , you get , a very high <unk> is , then you can only the rich to keep up .
i mean , each of us here i could take five times as much for our energy use it without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and even lomborg comes to think about .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research , it all shared it ? ''
he 's still , because of its former stories , with the <unk> associated , but he has understood that a very rare group is , and therefore does he now that <unk> .
and this is a rather , i wanted to be appropriately , follow .
the research , it 's just nuts , how much in the aid becomes .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope that your desire to be true . many , thanks .
bg : thanks .
years ago , here at ted , put it peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> '' ago .
the idea is quite simple . <unk> have the forming <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , about . <unk> tape , about . <unk> thread , and a marshmallow ; building .
the marshmallow ; you have top of being .
and , although it really just seems , it 's actually really though , because it people to push you very easy task force .
and so i thought that it 's an interesting idea is that i and it in a <unk> landscape .
it was a huge success .

usually run the most people putting yourself in terms of the task to orient .
you talk about , you go to look like it will look , they squeak , to go ,
then they are spending a little time in planning and organization . they 're drawing and put <unk> out .
they invest in a lot of their time in the <unk> time <unk> structures
and finally , before they no time , you have to take somebody decodes the marshmallow and they put him gently into the top , entering a step back and `` <unk> '' ! you adore them to work .
what but then , almost always , what happens is that `` <unk> '' to a `` <unk> '' is , because that weight of the marshmallow is causing the whole thing to bend , and <unk> .
there 's a series of people , the more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have to other , and under the worst of these are totally fresh <unk> .
they 're lying , they cheat , they are confused and make really <unk> shapes .
and there of course , teams , the more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have and under the best people are the freshness of the alumni of <unk> .
and this is quite astonishing .
like us , peter to tell you could make it 's not just the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask you get there is : how do that ? why ? what about whom ?
and peter told , `` none of kids spend time in it 's head of <unk> <unk> to be . ''
they invest , no time in <unk> .
but there 's another one more reason .
and that he said , of being trained by , the one time i plan to find , ok !
and then to realize .
now what happens , if you the marshmallow the top of package , they have no time , and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what <unk> do differently , this is that they do with the marshmallow is beginning and prototypes to build a successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow for the top , so that they were numerous times the ability to have <unk> prototypes to fix .
constructionists recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of <unk> <unk> .
and with every attempt to get the children are directly feedback , which works and what do n't .
this is the performance , to prototypes to work , far -- but we see once , how other teams of imagery .
the average for the most strongly about . <unk> , of creating the half of lawyers do something more , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who 's most successful ?
architects and engineers , luckily , .
<unk> is the ultimate , what i 've seen .
and why ? because they are triangles began to understand and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to make stable structures to build .
the ceos are about average . but here it gets interesting .
you put an executive administrator at itch , you going to dramatically better .
it 's unbelievable . you see , and see that `` this team is going to win . ''
you can the predictions . why does it ?
because they 're special faculties to the <unk> have .
they run the process , you understand him .
and , or the team that regulate and the work , paying the performance of teams and dramatically improve .
<unk> skills and <unk> and combined , lead to succeed .
if you 10 teams have to the typical of the standpoint , you ca . six , the robust -- structures .
i tried , well , poses .
i thought , we take the <unk> same .

what you think happened with these <unk> ?
what was the outcome ?
this happened . not a team had a robust structure .
if someone 's a <unk> high construction , which would , he had the price for home carried out .
so is not interesting is that high <unk> a powerful cooling effect of ?
we repeated this exercise with the same part of students .
what you think happened now ?
well understood it the advantage of `` <unk> . ''
so i was from the same , bad news crew , one of the best .
they have produced the highest construction in the least time .
there are so <unk> lessons for us , the nature of panic and success .
you might ask : why would somebody actually been spending a <unk> to build her ?
the reason is , i training digital tools and processes to create the team to help , cars , games and `` <unk> <unk> '' to make it .
and what the <unk> does is , it helps them , hiding from the master to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge and offers a shared experience , a common language , or obstruction . ethos , the real device to build .
and this is the value of me , so these simple little exercise .
and those of them , it 's very much , can <unk> visit .
it 's a blog , where you see how to the marshmallow is building .
there 's a <unk> there .
they 're crazy examples from earth , how people , the system to tune and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think is that construction , actually a <unk> sports .
it requires that we all our senses at the exercise to repair and that we think , optimal stopping to use , like our feelings and we do , in the challenge , the front of us is .
and sometimes it 's a small prototype of all , what it needs to us from a `` <unk> '' -- to a `` <unk> '' <unk> to bring .
and that can see a huge difference .
thank you .
we do such as we would have this one machine ,
a huge machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that 's a machine .
and everyone in this room must go inside .
and they can go into the past go , you can in the future to go ; they can not in here and now we 've left ,
and i wonder , what they elect them , because i my friends in the last time , often asked this question i 've , and they were all in the past , go .
i do n't know . they were interested in the time back , before it 's car , or twitter or `` america 's looking for the american idol '' .
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you kind of nostalgia , and wishful drawn is .
and that i understanding .
i 'm not part of the group , i must say .
i do n't want to the past , and that 's not , because i was a <unk> am --
it 's because of options on this planet does n't go back , you go ahead .
so i want in this machine , and i want to the future to go .

there was never quite a time , like this .
my <unk> died from all when she turned 60 were .
my grandparents had urged her this number on 70 .
my parents are the israel-loves-iran page on the heels .
there was so eloquently than a nine , my <unk> .
but it 's not just to people like us , because this is a major thing as this .
a kid , that capability in delhi 's born can expect , so long to live as the richest man on the 100 years ago .
think about it . that 's an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . the smallpox would have a billion people on this planet killed .
they have the demographics of the earth in a way to be shaped , how it 's no war , ever did .
they 're off . they have vanished .
we have you <unk> . <unk> .
in the wealthy world are diseases , the millions of us , just one generation , threatened , which nobody else .

you know that does anybody else , which is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to billion people to feed , that are some successes the scientific method .
and my view , is the scientific method , things to try to look , if it works , it change , if it 's not going to a the greatest achievements of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately , that 's been doing all the good news , because there is a few other problems , and they were frequently said ,
and one of this is that despite all of our greatest achievements a billion people on this world every day , starving , going to sleep .
this number drops , and she goes very quickly , and that 's embarrassing .

drinking water , <unk> country , the rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , and that as soon , and if we 're not because of chaos <unk> disappear , we also .
the question is so , we can do that ? i think it .
i think it 's clear that we food can produce , the billion people have food becomes , without the country , the you live , to rape her .
i think , we can make this world with power that they do n't both being destroyed .
i think that really , and no , that 's not wishful thinking .
but this keeps me at night , wake up -- one of the things that me at night , wake up . we have scientific advances are n't even so desperately in place like now , n't yet ,
and we were also do n't even the capacity , it 's reasonable <unk> , like us , it today can .
we 're on the cusp of amazing , astonishing design events on many places . and yet , i really is , hundreds of 300 years ago , the enlightenment , go back after we have to a time to be able to us in advance of fighting it have to us in about these things <unk> <unk> have to want more frontiers as well .
now , the midden , in their faith , so intimately that you 're not free will be here .
ca n't even the truth will they free .
and they stop , everybody has a right on his mind , even a right on his mind , for progress ,
but you know , what they 're not quite have ?
they do n't quite on their own facts . <unk> , they do n't .
and i have a while you needed to this figure out .
ago or a decade , i was a piece of the shots for `` the new yorker , '' written , a little billy bookcase .
and i was amazed to the resistance to bump , the resistant to the day , which at the most effective activity in health in the history of humanity .
i did n't know , what i should do , so i did just what i always doing , i wrote an article and i went on .
and was that i wrote an article about <unk> changed the food .
the same thing , only bigger .
the people were played a crazy .

but you know , i do so what i do . i wrote the article , i kept going .
i mean , i am foremost journalist ,
we tap , we reach into a , we eat out , that 's okay .
but these articles were doing , i am concerned , and i could n't figure out , why , and i would eventually it out .
and that it 's because that these <unk> to me nuts were doing it does n't <unk> were .
that were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and this led me that mess that ...
but then i thought , you know what , let 's face .
we 're at some point now gotten , the the we 're not just the same relationship to the progress , as before .
we 're talking <unk> them .
we talk to be ironic that , with a little <unk> point , `` the progress . ''
okay , for it 's the reasons , and i think we know , which causes that are .
we have this faith in institutions , in the authority , and sometimes in the science , however , and there 's no reason that 's not that should be .
you can just a name of them , and the people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the pieces of , <unk> , mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can your list them .
there are questions and problems with the people , which we believed that they always right , `` have . are so they are skeptical .
imagine if you ask , they ask you have evidence to urge you some evidence .
you take nothing more than giving up .
but now here 's : if you have evidence to get you have this evidence to assume , and in that we 're not good .
and i can that 's from the reason to say , we 're in an epidemic of fear kicks in one , i do n't yet i 've seen , and hopefully will never see again will .
before about 12 years was a story posted , a horrific story that the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine appeared in the connection made .
very scary .
tons of research has been done to see if that 's true .
tons of studies we should be done it 's a serious business .
the data came to spray .
the data were pouring out of the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all together , no significant correlation , no link , no .
it does n't matter . it does n't matter , because we of anecdotes -- believe , we think , what we see , to see to believe what causes that we really feel .
we think of not a spotted documents from a <unk> , of us data , there , and i understand that , i think that do we all .
but you know what ?
result of this was a catastrophic ,
catastrophic , because of this fact : the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world , where the immunization rate for <unk> down .

it 's awful .
what happened , that we could do .
now , i understand that . that i am .
because it has anybody here <unk> ?
has a single in the audience ever hear somebody on <unk> die see ?
it does n't very often .
what happens in this country , no , but the 160,000 times the world in the last year .
that are many deaths sort of <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because that 's not happening here is , we can it or crowd , and people like jenny mccarthy , can walk around and writing messages of fear and illiteracy , platforms like watching oprah and larry king live to preach it .
and that you can do , because they cause and correlation was not connecting .
they do n't understand that these things going to seem , but virtually never the same thing .
and this is something that we need to learn , very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk institute .
it liberated us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .

the guy in the middle , not so much .
he called `` paul <unk> .
he has just with a few other people a <unk> developed .
he can the life of <unk> , 500,000 in children per year in the developing to rescue .
well , not ?
so , that 's good , except that what paul walk and over the vaccines , speak , and says , how valuable they are , and that people just quit ought to complain .
and that he says , as indeed .
paul 's so a terrorist .
if paul charges in a public <unk> talks , it can not having fully armed <unk> statements .
he 's getting calls home , because the people he likes to tell you know where his kids going to school .
and why ? because paul a vaccine did .
i do n't need this say , but the vaccines are essential .
so you put it continues to return to the diseases come back , terrible disease , and this is happening .
we have in this country now <unk> .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon be kids back to die , because it 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not just at <unk> die .

a <unk> of mine got me , a few weeks ' written and told you think i 'm a little too <unk> .
nobody has that ever said earlier .

subtle .


now , i do n't know , maybe i entered this morning , somebody in lagos , a plane and fly straight to los angeles , the moment is he of ohio .
and in a few hours before landing he and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he 's one of <unk> <unk> tonight it has gone .
and he does n't know that it with a <unk> gets infected is , and we know that 's not too , because that 's the world .
this is the planet , the we live . they do n't like , as though he 's not .
we love it to us into a lie to the midden workers . we love this .
they have this morning , all their supply vitamins had taken ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , that you to boost your help .
i know , that you 've done , because half the americans , that every day , power .
you take this stuff , and you take an alternative to cure , and it does n't matter , how often we find that they 're useless .
the data back the time .
they darkening them their urine . do more you almost no .
that 's okay , they want to be in 28 billion dollars for the dark , urine of numbers .
i 'm with them , entirely too .
the darker the urine . dark .
why we doing this ? why we doing this ?
now , i think , i 'm sorry -- we hate the pharma industry .
we hate each one too strong government . we have n't trust the system .
and that we should n't either . our healthcare sucks .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> to us , it can afford .
we go so before that way , and where i 'm going , we ?
we walk into the poor of the <unk> .
that 's great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , it 's a serious business , because this stuff is crap , and we give a billion dollars for it out .
and i 've all kinds of artifacts here .
none of them -- <unk> , cheating , <unk> , cheating , <unk> , because i do n't even what that is , but we give a billion dollars for it out , it 's cheating .
and you know what ? if i 'm saying that , scream at me the people , `` what looks after it up ? let the people , but do , what you want .
you feel as they felt good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because it was no matter is , it 's the minister is , `` hmm , i 'm the evidence of my research , mammography does n't suppose '' or any <unk> , their patient with <unk> do n't want .
if you on this road entering , where i think , and the magic of evidence and science to replace , get them on a place , the the they do n't want to be .
they get to thabo mbeki 's in south africa .
he was 400,000 of people around , because he said that he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more effective than any antiretroviral drugs are , which we know that it the trajectory of aids , the brakes when you can .
hundreds undue death in a country , the worse than any other of this disease <unk> will .
they tell me not that these things are no grave implications .
the have you . that they 've always .
now , the <unk> epidemic , we 're in , is this ridiculous , struggle between the <unk> <unk> forming a food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about the words , about metaphors .
this ideology , not science .
everything , what we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , everybody brussels sprouts , from the people changed .
you know , there was no <unk> in the garden .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we have this all done .
we have it in the last for 11,000 years .
and the main complaint about it works and the main complaint was n't .
we 're got rid of what did n't work .
now we can it actually do . and of course there risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , do , and this stuff can million people to help , million people , their lives to extend .
that does n't you want to do ?
i must say , that i do n't .
we 're rejecting <unk> changed the food .
why we do that ?
now , what i always listening is : too many of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we do n't want a huge areas with one thing that 's wrong .
we do n't want to companies alive , and patent .
we do n't want to companies seeds have .
and so you know what my answer on all this is ?
yes , they 're right . to fix that we can .
it 's true , we have a huge <unk> , but that 's not science .
that has to science is nothing to do .
it 's right , moral , <unk> .
you know that the science does n't company is .
it 's no country .
it 's not just an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it works , he and sometimes not , but the idea that we the science is not allow you ought to her work to do , because we fear have is really a dead , and they keep millions of people from the blossom .
you know , in the next 50 years we will cover 70 percent more food have to grow as the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
they need that , and we give it 's not tell them .
and why ? <unk> changed the food .
we want people not just encourage , this <unk> stuff to eat , for example <unk> .
<unk> is something that half a billion people eat .
it 's like a potato .
it 's just a spotted calories . it sucks .
it does n't draw nutrients , it does n't have protein , and scientists building that all right at a .
and then you might the people that food and would n't be blind be .
they would n't starving , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it would be fair .
and everything , what i do you can say is : why , telling us that ?
i mean , we wonder : why , telling us that ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about , genetics . it 's not about the chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for our hormones , our <unk> on the greater our food , better food , unique instant of food .
it 's not the rice <unk> , it 's about , people are alive to get , and it 's the highest time , to understand what this .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do this , if we like to carry on how far i do we 're looking at a little bit guilty , the the we , i think , not guilty to be , high-tech colonialism .
there 's no other description for that , what happened here .
it is purely selfish , it 's ugly , it is not worthy , and we have this really stop .
after this funny , entertainment , they want so we might say `` you still in this ridiculous machine , and in the future to go ? ''
, sure . that i want , sure .
now , put them in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can this machine on all ask , what we want .
we can you sort of , where we 're sort of want , and we 're going to where they move , where we want .
we have these conversations that are doing , and we need to think , but if we in the machine , up , and in the future , we will be happy to be that made to have .
i know that we do it can , and here 's what i 'm concerned that 's something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a while i 'm interested to the <unk> . it 's strange you might seem to give a magician interested in that , it was because , you look at it as i believe , `` a deception , to something real space is , if it tightly enough to believe . ''
with other words , <unk> have in some studies have a measurable effect , i showed the <unk> , just so , because the person thinks , with her going to be a pharmaceutical facilities , or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , there , if the patient , tightly enough to believe , a measurable effect in the body , you the <unk> calls .
a conjurer 's going to something real space , because somebody 's like walking .
so that we 're also understanding , i want you 're a fundamental , very simple trick to show .
and i 'm going to show you how he works . this is a trick , the least for the 1950s , in any <unk> for children sleep deprivation .
i even though i 've got him from <unk> <unk> magic of <unk> in the 1970s , learned .
i 'm going to him for you carry out and then you explain .
and then i 'm going to explain why i would explain .
so , you see , what happens .
that knife , that you see what can ; my hand , you see what can .
i 'm going to the knife . just like in my <unk> think .
i corporate my sleeve .
and to ensure that nothing in my sleeve , go away , or from him out , i 'll just my wrist , right here <unk> .
on this way you can see that to any time something to move . long as i 'm here <unk> , can not in my sleeve , hiking , or to emerge .
and the goal is what 's very simple .
i 'm going to my hand up , and hopefully , if everything goes well , is that knife by my bare physical <unk> rice mill .
it sits actually so stuck in its place that i do it shake it , without that knife <unk> .
nothing , moves in my sleeve , or come out , no <unk> . and you can all study .
<unk> !
so , that 's a trick , i often a little kids <unk> , for magic that interest , because you can help you very much about deception to learn , if you look closely , although it 's a very simple <unk> trick is .
probably know many of them in this room that trick .
he works .
i think that knife in my hand .
i 'm saying that i my wrist <unk> , to ensure that nothing in my sleeve , go away , or out , and this is a lie .
the reason that i my wrist <unk> , is that at the real secret of illusion of humor .

wonderful trick ?
there back seat , somebody , not a childhood had .
so , he here , here . right .
and when i <unk> , changing the hands on its position .
and now you could talk about , why that 's a conjurer is , why do n't we 're walking , down here 's just three fingers to see are , because the mind and the way that he information processing , they do individually counts , one , two , three , but dissipates it as a group can see .
but it 's now here 's not actually , and then i open my hand .
of course , it 's where rice mill , but not by the <unk> my body , it by a trick , through my <unk> , now there is .
and when i mean by hand , i 'll conclude , going on the same thing , by i <unk> , going through this action , hidden behind the finger , again <unk> .
i 'll use these hand away . and there is the knife .
this trick that you can be your friends and neighbor to demonstrate . thanks .
now , which has the <unk> to do ?
a year ago , or so , i read a study that i was really just blew it .
i 'm not a doctor or explorers , and so she was that for me an amazing thing .
it , which is what turned out : if you a <unk> in a white pill to flourish , in the form a <unk> , is that just a round , white pill , a certain kind of measurable effect .

and that , although almost none of any kind of pharmaceutical industry ... there are just <unk> .
but a white stirring it 's not as well as a blue pill .
what ? that made me really freak .
it turns out , but out that 's not yet , everything is .
if you capsules that will , are the more effective than pills and every form .
a colored the capsule on the one end of yellow and the red is that 's better than a white capsule .
well , the <unk> plays a role .
a stirring it twice a day is not as good for three pills -- i can i 'm not at the exact statistics , remember . i 'm sorry .
the key , but is , ...
... that 's also the <unk> a difference .
and the shape it plays a role .
and if you the ultimate <unk> have to you have to the needle in our grasp .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> a <unk> substance that you a patient penitentiary .
that creates a very powerful image in mind . that 's very much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i 'm going to you in a different times more polite , if we have a <unk> have .
the fact , so this is that the white stirring it 's not so good looks like the blue pill , not so good looks like a cramped capsule that are not so good looks like the needle .
and none of it has some really not pharmaceutical property . it 's only way we believe , in us a greater impact achieved .
i wanted to know if i did this idea for a trick could use .
i suspect something that obviously a conjurer is , and let 's really look .
we know from an attorney in the study that you to the needle has to grab , if it to it supposed to go .
this is an 18th-century inch long <unk> . it 's very , <unk> . and i 'm going to you start with a little bit to render time .
this is really my best meat . it 's not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not <unk> from hollywood .
i 'm now this needle in my skin and stick and through them through a model , until you on the other hand up <unk> .
if you very nasty by -- if they easily in famished and fall -- i think that 's a few friends , the last night in the hotel room by raising , and some people , i did n't know , and it 's a woman who almost suffocated that has gone .
i propose , so , if you 're evil to be , then you looking for the next 30 seconds away . or , you know what , i 'm the first <unk> part back here .
you can it 'll see , you can but also <unk> , if you want .
so , it goes like , right here , where my ham starts , the bottom of my <unk> i 'll just a little <unk> do .
does , i really sorry . it 's crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin and the other way back out .
now we 're actually in the same condition that we do the <unk> had .
about .
but now you can be my fingers do n't count , right ?
so , when i do you show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well ,
i know what the people think , if you see that .
they say `` okay , is certainly not so stupid and <unk> yourself in the skin , just about us a few minutes to speak . ''
now , then i 'm going to show you .
look like this out ? well .
yes , i know .
and the people behind , `` okay . i did n't that 's seen . ''
the people in the <unk> come here in .
they let 's me give you from around that show .
it 's my skin . this is not <unk> from hollywood .
this is my ham , and i can that <unk> .
i 'm sorry . if you very bad will , look away , look not going .
now , the back or the that later at some point on video to see , will say , `` well , see that , yes , fairly impressive , but if it 's really would , he would -- you see here 's a hole and there , if it really cool would , it would we bleed . ''
okay , they let me a low blood for you <unk> .
yes , it there .
ordinarily would i 'm the needle elements .
i would my arm and clean and you is that 's not had lesions are .
but i think , in this program here and with the intention , from a conjurer 's something real to do , i 'm the needle is figure out there was go and so from the stage to go .
we are the next few days a couple more time to face .
i hope that you look forward , already on . thank you .
everybody talks about today about that happiness .
i have some people the number of books are among them , it , `` <unk> '' in the title , in the last five years or published by and they gave after about 40 up , and there was a lot more .
there 's a massive wave of <unk> of luck of explorers .
there 's very much <unk> .
everybody would like the people are happier .
but despite all these are flowing from work , there are several different cognitive fall that 's sort of almost impossible to make sure about happiness was thinking .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive and drop of action .
this is for <unk> , of their own happiness is think , and it applies for scientists , of happiness is think that , because it turns out that we just like this mess that are like everybody else .
the first of traps is a <unk> , complexity of admit that .
it turns out that the word `` happiness is simply not a tool in the word carrying is , because we do it up too many different things work .
i think , there 's a particular significance of us to shrink it could , but in the great and all this is something that we give up to be , and we 're going to the complicated tomes of view , would have to this , what well-being is .
the second case is a really confuses most of experience and memory , in basically consists of them between be happy in his life and be happy about his life , or happy with his life .
and these are two very different ideas , and they 're both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the <unk> fact that we 're not about a situation to think that the well-being is affected , without its significance to distort deeply .
i mean , this is a real cognitive and trap .
there is simply no way , it 's going to get .
now i 'd like with an example start by someone , that one <unk> had to one of my lectures , a story , updating them . [ unclear ... '' he said , he had a symphony heard , and it was absolutely <unk> music , and very end of the addition , there was a <unk> <unk> sound .

but that i did n't .
what it ruined had been the memories of the experience .
he had the experience i had .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had .
they <unk> not , because he 'd be a memory <unk> was ; the memory that was ruined , and the memory that was all , what he to keep it had received .
what we really saying is that we about ourselves and over the other people think we could in terms of two types of self .
there 's a <unk> itself , that in the present to live and the present , if you know , is able to the past , back to see , but basically , just the present .
it 's the <unk> itself , that the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the physician will say , `` does it 's going to hurt , i turn it 's <unk> ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> itself , and that <unk> itself is that , that <unk> and the story of our lives upright , you get , and it 's <unk> , that the doctor eye-opening and make it 's the question : `` how they in the last time that feel ? ''
or `` how was their journey to albania ? '' or a similar .
these are two very different entities that <unk> themselves and that <unk> itself , and the two to confuse this is part of <unk> of <unk> from happiness .
so , that <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and the beginning to do with a basic reaction on our memories of -- it begins immediately .
we tell you 're not just a story , when we talk about to make stories to tell .
our memory someone tells us stories , that go out what we of our experiences , keep his plan is a story .
and they let <unk> with an example start .
there 's an old one study .
that are real patients , a painful procedure <unk> .
i 'm not to go . you today is not more painful , but she was painful , as this study in the 1990s , and did was .
they were asked , everybody loses 60 seconds about their pain to report .
and here are two patients . that are your records .
and they 're wondering , `` who by both have more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient to b has explicit , many others suffered . his <unk> was no longer , and every minute of pain , the patient 's had had a patient to b , and more .
but now there 's a different question : `` how much i thought that these patients that they were stunted growth ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient 's a lot <unk> <unk> at the <unk> had a patient to b .

and none of these stories is very <unk> or a great -- but one of them is this shows ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the , the worse is it , where the pain , very end up its pinnacle . it 's a bad history .
where we know that ?
because we these people after their <unk> ask you have , and too much later , `` how bad was the whole thing overall ? `` well ,
and she was much worse for a , as to b in the <unk> .
so , that 's a direct fight between the <unk> themselves and the <unk> itself .
of view of <unk> even had a b is clearly a <unk> time .
now , what you with the patient is a , you could do , and we 've actually a clinical experiments , and it 's been made , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of the patient is a to extend through you just the hose in it does not too much of him to the seating chart .
this is going to say that the patient is suffering , but only a little and much less than before .
and if you that a few minutes long makes you have caused that <unk> themselves from the patient 's worse off is and you have caused that <unk> themselves from the patient is a lot better off is , because now , your patient 's a better story about his experience has been .
mystery of ooh , a story from ?
and this is for the stories that the memory that provides carbon-free and it 's also for the stories that we invent .
a tan , a story , are <unk> , great moments , and ends .
leave you 're very , very important , and in this case <unk> the end .
so , that <unk> itself alive with his life and continuously .
it has moments of <unk> , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're going to be lost forever .
i mean , the most enjoyable times of life -- and i have the chairs , you know , the psychological present and recognized as about three seconds long , which means , you know that it 's in a life around 600 million of there . in a month there 's about 600,000 , the most of you leave any track .
the most of you 're completely ignored by <unk> itself .
and yet given you sort of the sense that they count things that what happens during those moments of <unk> going on our lives .
it 's the limited resource that we use as we 're on this world .
and how we they consume it would seem to matter , but that 's not the story that the <unk> even for us to keep .
so we do this <unk> themselves and that <unk> itself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the people interact with time .
of view of <unk> itself , if you a holiday , and the second one week , just like this is good as the first , then is the <unk> vacation 's twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
yes , so that 's not for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> vacation trip much better than the <unk> holiday , because there was no new memories , added to be .
they have the story does n't changed .
and on that 's time , the critical variable that a <unk> itself is different from a <unk> itself . time has very much impact on this story .
so , that <unk> to make more , as to remember , and stories to tell .
it 's actually <unk> , the decisions , because if you a patient who have to the , we say , two <unk> at two different surgeons did and they decide , which he would choose to do , it 's the , the votes in the memory , the less bad news is , and this is the surgeon , selected will .
this <unk> itself has no voice in this choice .
what we choose not between the experiences . we choose between living memory of experiences .
and even if we at the future thinking , we think of our future is n't usually as painful experiences .
we think about our future , as <unk> memories .
but basically , can you look , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> itself , and they do that <unk> even think more than one , this sort of the <unk> itself <unk> of experiences that <unk> to do n't need .
i have the sense that if we spend holidays do that a lot of the case is , that means we make a vacation largely the services of <unk> itself .
and this is a little bit hard to justify so , i think .
i mean , very <unk> we of our memories ?
this is one of explanations , for the dominance of <unk> even gave it .
and when i think about , i think of a holiday , we 're on a few years in antarctica 've done , clearly the best vacation trip was , i ever had , and i think quite often it in proportion to how often i think of other <unk> think .
and i 've probably from my memory of these <unk> journey , i 'd say about 25 minutes in the last four years <unk> .
now , when i ever the folder open , you have to 600 to paint it , i would have another one hour spent .
so , that are three weeks , and that are the peak half hours .
because it seems only one of disagreement , to .
now , i like a little extreme to be , you know , it , how little appetite for me on the <unk> of memories i 've , but itself , if you more of doing there 's a real question . why we spend their memories so much weight in <unk> to the weight , that we were moments be ?
so i want to you about an experiment to think .
you can think about their next on holiday , you know that the end of <unk> all their pictures of interstellar bypass , and they get a <unk> drug , so , nothing to remember being .
now , you to the same two holidays and vote ?
and if you a different vacation and vote would , there 's a conflict between her two types of self and you need to think it like this conflict decide , and it 's not obvious , because if you in terms of time thinking they get an answer . and if you in terms of memories , think they may have a different answers to get .
why we the <unk> picking that we choose which is an issue that , we put a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self : drop two words from fortune on .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one year . '' itself .
so they can ask : how fortunate that is that <unk> itself ?
and then they would ask : how fortunate that are those moments in life of <unk> itself ?
and they 're all -- fortunately for those moments , is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions , the measured it can be ?
and , incidentally , we 're now capable of a pretty good idea to get from fortune of <unk> itself across the time .
if you after the luck of <unk> yourself questions , it 's a whole other thing .
this is not about , as happy one person who lives .
it is about how to get happy or encouraged by the person , this person over their lives think .
very different conception .
everybody , those terms n't distinguish the data exploration of happiness screw it , and i belong to a lot of explorers of well-being of the study of happiness when you do i screwed that have on these same way .
the distinction between the luck of <unk> themselves and the average happiness of <unk> itself is in the last decade has realized that 's been , and now , tries to be , the x-ray to measure .

in the last few years , so we 've begun to talk about the luck of those two types of self to learn .
and the main one lesson that we , i think , we 've learned is that it 's quite distinct .
you know , please anybody with his life is , and that teaches you really not a lot of how i 'm happy , he compartmentalizes his life living and vice versa .
just about them a sense of the correlation to convey the correlation is about <unk> .
what this is that if you who would meet and you would tell them , oh , his father 's a <unk> of how much would you about his greatness all know ?
well , they were about its size , you know , but there 's much uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell them that somebody would be life than eight on a scale of 10 <unk> , you have much uncertainty of how i 'm happy , he 's with his <unk> itself .
the correlation is so low .
we know about what the average happiness of <unk> .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is basically means , very pleased to be with people that we like , time to spend with people that we 'd like .
there are other occupational pleasure , but this is dominant .
so if you that happiness of those two types of to maximize that we want you will end very different things .
the implication of the , what i 'm here we 've said this is that we 're lucky to do n't imagine trying to , as a substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely different conception .
now , very quickly , one another reason , from that we do n't know about happiness is think we can this is that we 're not the same things should care if we talk about the life thinking and if we actually life .
so if you the simple question , as happy the people in california are you will not the correct answer to get .
if you this question , you think that the people in california , happy to be if you , we say , in ohio state in .
and what happens is that if you about that live in california to think , you think about the difference in california , and other places , and that difference is , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out that painless climate is not very important for the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful , that will decide , as happy people are .
now , but , because the thoughtful about yourself responsible is , you can you end -- some people might end up to california are retracting .
and it 's sort of interesting to track , what happens with people , to california to move in hopes , especially happy to be .
now , you <unk> themselves will not become happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they 're going to think that you happier , are , because if you think about you will remember being , how awful the weather in ohio . and they 're going to feel like you to the right decision to meet .
it 's very difficult , clear about well-being of thinking , and i hope , i do you an impression of authorship , how hard it 's .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question of them .
thank you .
now , when we 're on a few weeks on his phone 've mentioned , you to me that 's a pretty interesting result was that 's out of <unk> survey ever come .
this is something , what they 're involved to be able to because they 're a few minutes left would have ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most exciting results that we 're in the <unk> survey found have is a number that we absolutely not to find we did .
we found that in terms of the luck of <unk> itself .
if we exams , emotions with the income <unk> .
and it turns out , under a minimum income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a representative sample , under a salary from over 600,000 dollars in
60,000 years .
dk : 60,000 years .
60,000 dollars in are the people were distressed , and they 're increasingly less and the poorer . they 're going .
what we get a completely flat line .
i mean , i rarely so flat line seen .
and what happens is obvious that the money , no <unk> <unk> , but that lack of money , surely the misery <unk> , and we can this case misery very , ok to measure .
in terms of the other self , of <unk> itself , you get a different story .
more money you made is increasing levels is you .
this is not for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american <unk> it 's about life , freedom , the quest for happiness .
when people that submitted to take seriously , would , i mean , it appears all the head to ask , everything , what we think , for example , in terms of policy and so forth .
there 's a chance that politicians that the country , generally a submitted , like to take seriously , would and based on politics , would make us ?
dk : you know , i believe that 's acknowledged that there for the role <unk> in politics .
the recognition is starting to be in the united states , no question , but in the uk does it right and in other countries that it does it right .
the people are doing , recognizing that it on happiness might think should , you look at the political thinking .
it will be a while , and the people will discuss them , <unk> study to , or whether they <unk> study to , so we have this debate pretty soon bring .
how you 're lucky to raise oxytocin can go very differently depending upon it , as you think and if you look at the <unk> even think , or whether you look at the <unk> even imagine .
that will require policy changes , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states <unk> you , that <unk> the population , to measure .
this is , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
now , it strikes me , this is subject , or should at least the most exciting for political debate to pursue be about the next few years .
thanks for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm jane mcgonigal , i attended montessori games .
i <unk> now 10 years , <unk> . and my goal for the next decade is , it as easy to do , the world in reality to save , in <unk> to save .
i have a design for . i want more people to convince them , including you all , more time with the play the greater and <unk> games to spend .
now , and we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` this is a whole time for games . ''
maybe a little too much time , if you <unk> how many problems we desperately in the real world to solve .
but in fact , my research at the center for the future , according to is the exact opposite <unk> .

in fact , i am convinced that , if we the next century on this planet will survive want to do this time to dramatically increase .
i 've calculated that required at age 21 billion hours <unk> per week is .
this seems to start doing some <unk> , so again , i do it , so it work today ca : if we have issues like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity want to solve , i think we need to try to play online for at least , 21 billion hours per week , the end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture that defines kind of fact , why i believe that play , so critical for survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to the feelings at play catch . so he 's going on the players have a camera and i built .
this is one of the classic expressions of the play .
if you do n't want gamers are , suppose you may be some of nuances in this picture .
you probably this sense of urgency , some anxiety , but also <unk> concentration , to figure out in that solve one really tough problem .
if you also play , you see some of nuances . here , the way up <unk> eyes and the mouth that are a sign of astonishing optimism . the eyebrows present surprise .
this is a player , the edge of so-called <unk> <unk> says .
oh , you know that . ok , neat . so we have some outstanding players , here .
a <unk> victory is a result , this so extremely positive is that they were n't even knew that 's possible .
it was almost go beyond the imagination .
and if you do it , they 're shocked me , and they actually to something like 're capable . this is a <unk> victory .
this bridge player 's about to <unk> victory .
and this is it , on millions of their faces of <unk> around the world look have , if we are obstacles to the next century in the attack them . the face of those , the contrary of all odds on the edge of <unk> <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we see more like this face in real life , if we difficult problems facing .
i refer to it as the `` in life , i 'm sick '' <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes , ok .
this is me , like , `` in life , i 'm sick '' <unk> do .
this is a graffiti -- in my former head home in berkeley , california where i in my ph.d. studying why we in games are better than in real life .
this is an issue that many football players have .
we think that we in reality is not there are so good as in games .
and i 'm not only eat fewer truck successfully , though the people to be heard .
we reach into <unk> more . i mean , in relation with the motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired to collaborate together .

and in reality , if we fail , if we ended up debris that bump , feel we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated correctly . we feel threatened , perhaps most depressed , frustrated , or <unk> .
these feelings , we 've never , if we play games , in games , there it does n't .
and this is it , what i was a phd want to look .
why is it into play an impossible to think , you could n't simply reach it all ?
how do these feelings of the play in the reality to spread ?
so i looked at play like warcraft , that the ideal place for the collaborative solving , offering .
and i have some things i realized that epic <unk> in <unk> as possible to do .

but not just some justice mission , but a mission that are related to its current level of the game will fit , right ?
so they make this .
they have no one task , you ca n't solve .
but always on the edge of their skills , so you have to try better . but there 's no unemployment in warcraft .
you 're not around and turning the lob , there are always very specifically something important to do .
and there are tons of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of people to engage with you to you very epic mission accomplished close .
that we have in real life , not just like , that feeling that in a <unk> tons of employees agreed .
there are also this epic story , this inspiring story , why we 're there and what we 're going to have .
then we can get this whole positive feedback .
they 've driven by mesmerizingly next level up '' and `` plus-one strength , '' or heard `` plus-one emotional intelligence . ''
this constant , feedback , there 's not in real life .
if i think this stage , leaving , i did not , is plus-one talk , and plus-one crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i get in real life that feedback , not .

they 're just better than the reality .
until now have all the world of <unk> together <unk> million years , so i spent the virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
this is not necessarily bad thing .
it might sound bad .
but to put it 's , in the context to see , before <unk> million years , began our first <unk> upright , to go .

ok , so if we talk about , how much time we 're now with play action gamers to do that sense , when you the time in terms of scale of human development in front of a nap , which is extremely jolly .
but also be appropriate . because it turns out that we , by we have been available to use , actually changing this , what we of the capacity .

this is the truth . what i believe .
consider , at this interesting one statistic that has drifted from a researcher at the carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man of today , in a country with fiberglass <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st century . age .
so , 10,000 hours , is an extremely interesting number , from two reasons :
first time , for children in america are <unk> hours of the exact <unk> that they do in school to spend , from the fifth . grade to leave the high school -- if you never absent .
so we have is a complete <unk> , the young people just learning , what it , a good players to be like everything else , what you in school to learn .
and may have any of the new book of encountering malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> '' to read .
so you know about his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great science with the <unk> that , if we are 10,000 hours with the <unk> studies of any subject to the 21st century . age of weeks , we 're going to solving it .
we 're so good at , whatever you come to the most famous to the world .
so , what we have here , is an entire generation of young people , the <unk> .
the big question is so , `` what exactly are the player <unk> right ? ''
because if we that could figure , we would sort of before there <unk> human potential to spend .
so many people we currently in the world , the least an hour a day with <unk> spend .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people , the remarkably well , `` something . ''
and the next decade we have another one billion player , the remarkably well , whatever .
if it 's not yet have heard ,
the <unk> developed <unk> , the energy bills , and on <unk> work , instead of the <unk> , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , online can play .
you 're expecting an extra one billion player in the next decade .
so we have total of 1.5 billion player .
so what i began to go to look what it is , what good at these games to solving this issue .
here are the four things that i found . first , `` <unk> .
ok , you can think that as the extreme <unk> ago .
<unk> is that urge , having to be done , a barrier to solving , together with the cell , we have a <unk> hope spots on success .
players have always remember that a <unk> victory 's possible , and that there , it 's worth , it to try , right .
players are not sit around .
players are masters of spiders poet of social networks .
there 's a lot more interesting studies , to know that we are more like , after we with you 've been playing , even if they 're evil to beat .
the reason for this is that 's lots of trust a token , with somebody a game to play .
we rely on that someone time with us feeling that the rules <unk> 'll notice , we can the goal , and to <unk> what staying .
so it possible that <unk> this filling out of ties to trust and each other .
as a result of that we build greater understanding social relations , on .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason that the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week , playing , as <unk> .
the reason is that , if we play , we 're actually become happier and , hard to work , as if we wanted to relax , or doing nothing .
we know that we as human beings , optimal stopping to work , if we were hard , significant effort to do .
and the players are always ready , hard to work , if you the task .
and ultimately , epic meaning .
players love it , part of awe <unk> missions <unk> <unk> to be .
here 's a <unk> to this into the right light to the back . you know all been looking at wikipedia , the <unk> the world .
the second largest <unk> the world , with very much has 80,000 entries that 's one of warcraft <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information of warcraft , on the lenape as of some other issue in each other <unk> the world .
they create a very epic story .
they create a very epic source of knowledge of warcraft .
ok , that are so for two superpowers , to a single might lead . players are <unk> , hopeful way of individuals .
there are people , the cell , it as a single change the world can .
and the only problem is that they say , you can the virtual worlds to change , but not the real .
this is the issue that i 'm going to solve four attempts .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is genius . he examines why do people that much time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , `` we 're going to witness of not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds , and <unk> . ''
and that by an economist . so he 's logical .
and he says ...
not as i believe -- i <unk> games , i 'm going to <unk> .
so he says , that makes actually make sense , because the player can in <unk> achieve more than in real life .
they can go into play a stronger form social ties to knit , in real life . they get more feedback and rewards in games than in real life .
so , he says , it 's currently is entirely obvious that players are more time in the virtual world as in the real action gamers .
i agree that first time to that 's logical .
but it 's definitely not <unk> .
we must start to the real world in a game to turn .
my whole inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years , actually shared .
there are these <unk> cube , from <unk> . you know ?

and that were sort of the first of humans evolved <unk> .
and if you with the mechanics of the ancient greek <unk> <unk> 're familiar , you know , maybe this story . the story about , and why games have invented by .
according <unk> were playing , specifically , <unk> , in the kingdom <unk> as a famine is fabricated .
supposedly , there was such a great famine , the king of <unk> to a crazy idea i decided that .
the people had stunted . the people fought side .
it was an extremely unlikely position . you took an extreme solution .
so they invented it , according <unk> , that <unk> and boil down a national energy strategy . on a day would you eat . the next day , you 'd play .
and they were as much in the <unk> figure out to be that i 'll play , so fascinating that are and us with <unk> , <unk> productivity , surrounded by that you remember that would that 's nothing to eat , there .
and then , the next day , you 'd play . and the next day would you eat .
and according <unk> they survive , so for 18 years that famine , by them on a day eating and the next was playing .
likewise , i think , we 're using today , games .
we put play a cell to the suffering from the real world to escape .

but that does n't have the end .
that 's exciting .
according <unk> was for 18 years of famine is not better . so i decided to the king , one last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom , two camps .
they played a <unk> and the winner allowed to a <unk> adventure , it undo .
they left <unk> and made out on the lookout for a new home . they were just so many people back , how it food to survive there and we picked up the rest for an area , you can thrive ; they could .
this sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> showing that the <unk> , the later this remotely muddied rich , trained , the same dna as the old <unk> exaggeration .
so , and scientists recently the notion that <unk> ' crazy story actually true .
and we geologists thought of evidence of global cooling , almost 20 years we took what the famine tell you could .
so i could take these crazy story of voices .
maybe they 're actually their people through play rescued , by , for 18 years in games <unk> have and then this <unk> had and so much about that playing with each learned that it makes the whole civilization have saved .
so that we can also .
we 're playing around since 1994 warcraft .
it was the first <unk> in real the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they played for 18 years <unk> , we get 16 years ago warcraft .
i 'm saying , we 're ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of your civilization , looking for a new world . so i mean , 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should look at <unk> that half of us an hour a day to play is spending , until we problems in the real world have solved .
i know , they 'll ask , `` how we 're solving problems of the real world into play ? '' and this particular question i mean work in the last decade at the center for the future is devoted to .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it statements made out how we the future to understand why should .
we do n't want to try to the future , prior to say .
what we want , is the future to create .
we want to the best results , imagine . and then people do <unk> , this idea in the reality , do-it-yourself .
we ask ourselves in epic <unk> ago , and give people who are , you to achieve .
i 'll take a very quickly about three games that i 've designed to try to people in epic <unk> in their own future to give you .
this is `` the world without oil . ''
this game is by 2007 .
it 's a <unk> , where you a <unk> overcome .
the <unk> 's invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it for it 's realistic it and they 're real life in fact , without oil life . so , if you to play and register , they tell us , where you live . and then gives you <unk> in real , the show you , how much oil costs , what 's not there , <unk> affected is how to transport , compromised going to do our school closed organizations are , whether it was rioting . and they have to figure out how they 're real life make , if it was . and we ask them , about to blog , and videos or an entrepreneurship , last priority .
we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and tested . and we have you ever since the last three years , surrounding us .
and i can tell you , it was a <unk> experience .
nobody wants to life change , because it 's good for the environment is , because we do it should .
but if you in a <unk> adventures are and told you get `` let 's the oil out . ''
this is a fascinating about adventure , on that you go .
they find out , as you survive on them . most of the players have the game <unk> habits and invasive .
so we worked for the next <unk> play a bigger , higher purpose and i put than just <unk> .
we have this game `` <unk> '' at the center for the future research labs .
starting point is that calculation of <unk> that the people , 23 years on planet left .
this supercomputer that 's called `` global <unk> <unk> '' , of course .
the call to players to sign , we have almost like a `` <unk> '' <unk> forged .
you know the jerry <unk> , where it 's `` <unk> '' there . they have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> and all together , you can save the world .
but in our basketball game , instead of only five million people , we say , everybody 's in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to create .
8,000 player up playing the game 's eight weeks for .
they were 500 incredibly creative solutions that they <unk> can , `` <unk> '' google .
and the last game , we take advantage at 3 . march . it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you this game , close to get them from the world bank , the distinction , `` social <unk> , '' the end by 2010 .
we 're working with the universities all of sub-saharan africa and they invite one , social <unk> to learn .
we have a comic to . we have `` level up '' for <unk> understand , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want you all invited to this game with young people to share , over the world , particularly in <unk> , of benefits , put together in their own social enterprises , to imagine the world to save .
i 'm going to finish .
i want you some questions .
what , you think that happens when the next ?
we have all these fantastic player , we have games that show us , what we can do , but we have the real world still not be saved .
well , i hope you to me in that i agree that players , human resources are , we go to work in real life can use , and games to a great significance to change .
we all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability , strong social networks to knit , <unk> and the craving for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we all the post-war history play games to pick on this planet , but one century to survive .
and i hope that they 're going to me like to design and play .
if i put the next decade <unk> , i 'm at two things not sure , that we have every <unk> future can create , and that we all kinds of play games can .
so i say , let the <unk> games are beginning !
thanks .
i would you like to share something which i was a few months at writing an article for <unk> wired , allah .
i 'm at writing , my <unk> fingertips , but i was with the physicist encounters of <unk> already done , and i fell on that i do n't even in my life <unk> 've what that word `` the disabled , '' really means .
i read them the post .

<unk> : posed , strong , ankle . ''
i have this list of a friend says to read and i had first of laughter , it seemed like this ridiculous , but i was just give up , `` <unk> '' and i could no longer <unk> , and had to stop to read and i first capture for this <unk> <unk> and the with <unk> emotional shock .
obviously this was a <unk> , old <unk> . i told me just thought that the copy 've actually be old .
but actually it was a copy the early '80s , when i just with the primary school , i sat down and so began to my <unk> outside of <unk> outcomes of building and to form , even in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and god , unless you what i did n't <unk> used .
i saw this post take seriously , i would be in a world was born , that someone like me as a person who avail ourselves would , whose lives in <unk> how positive gon na be . today , but i 'm going to the opportunity and adventure , i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i immediately the <unk> of 2009 , the inaugural address and expecting me to come here a <unk> contribution to find .
here is the <unk> version of this <unk> .
happen , it 's not much better .
especially in shock to me the last two words , `` an asteroid <unk> '' `` well , '' and `` eat healthy . ''
but it 's not just about the words .
it 's about , about the people think that we do with these words to describe .
it 's about the values , in those words stuck , and how we these values , engineered .
our language affects our thinking and how we the world and the people around us see .
many <unk> societies , including the greek and the roman , have really believed that the <unk> of <unk> a great force , because that , what you shout <unk> , also <unk> can .
so , what we want to actually <unk> -- a <unk> people or a <unk> people ?
just been a human <unk> as a child to call , it 's essential , they 're not limit , and you very modern-sounding ideas <unk> .
it would not rosy , you doors to open up ?
a person , for me the door opened , was my pediatrician happens at <unk> . chair dupont , the institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he says , dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , how they were able to think , the most americans are not accurate and remain they could . so he became increasingly , dr. p. called .
and dr. p. wore it always very interesting to fly and it was for the work with kids , just like created .
i found the time , i in hospital , i spent 've , just great -- the way on my <unk> .

and you can think , i actually , as <unk> child with dr. p. negotiate and so trying to this exercise to stop , <unk> no success .

and if you get it can , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
this was obviously just a lot easier to move from dr. p. , so i the activities that do that i do n't do n't want to the prospect that the richest five-year-old kid in the ward in the stick to be . but he got me in fact , chubby , my daily <unk> with new eyes to see . so it became a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder now , how much of his vision of me as strong and <unk> young girl with my <unk> shaped , and i 'm so imagine being able to me as one of nature of unfinished , <unk> and <unk> person to see .
this is just an example of many , like adults into <unk> the imagination of a child encourage it can .
but how the been quoted examples of the <unk> prove that makes us our language , no room , to imagine , what we all want them would say it any given to give themselves , as <unk> people to see .
our language of secondhand the social changes afterwards , in many cases of a technological change that caused by .
by a lot of view from outer you can make sure that tell my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titanium knee and artificial <unk> for the aging body , it allow people , really all their opportunities to use and over the borders , you your natural what happens to put it , in addition to develop , not going to talk from social <unk> platforms , to people , a own identity to give you go to own way of landmark points , and , with the world , to join and orient to employ them to choose .
maybe it brings so this technological change actions , because according to make it always a different truth gave , which is that every man of society , something very <unk> and very <unk> can give and that the human ability to adapt to our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt to be -- that 's an interesting story , because people to me over there 's not just want to tell , like me with the odds , really matters , and i 'm going to a confession , that sentence , for me never <unk> and i was always very uncomfortable with it felt , the questions of people to answer , and i think , gradually i do know , why .
that sentence by interacting with tremendous odds that lives of the idea that success or fortunately it depends , a challenge to solving , without lots of that with the associated experience is shaped to be . as though my life so successful gon na be , because i the kinds of falling of life with a prosthetic stare could , or how do anything that people to me with my disability to avail ourselves .
but the truth is that we change . course , we are from the challenge of coined , whether they 're physically , emotional , or even the two is
and i 'm saying that 's good .
tremendous odds are not an obstacle , that we <unk> need to pick up with our lives better clear to come .
tremendous odds are just to our lives .
and i get choked to the odds , as my shadow , to see .
sometimes something encouraging i notice that it 's a lot of al-qaeda is , sometimes it 's hard to see , but he 's time with me .
and i want to think so the impact , or obstruction . the increasing intensity of <unk> of people to be degrading .
there in your odds , and challenges , and they are just <unk> real and each person 's so slightly differently . but the question is not , if we do with tremendous odds that have come , or not , but how we make sure to come .
so we 're not just for granted , the people would we love , <unk> to keep , but they also to prepare , well , so clear to come .
and we prove to our children any standard accommodations , if we do you feel that they 're going to do n't customize to .
you have two things that dividing , all , the medical fact , an amputee , to be and for other the social think about , if i disabled , or not .
and to be honest , to the only real and persistent and the disabled , with the i cut back to , is that the world around , says , they could do to me to the definition , we described .
in our desire , the people to protect , at heart of oil and you the cold , the leader in fact about their medical prediction , communicate or even a prediction for quality to ask , you expect , we need to watch that we ca n't the <unk> to put that somebody actually be disabled .

if we have a people do n't <unk> treat , and not all its power and opportunity to perceive and to acknowledge , we make in addition to the natural struggle , you might lead to have one another disease .
we <unk> a man , for our society , a value .
so we have the <unk> look out and we all the realm of human possibility to focus .
at ensure but this is that 's between the perception of our mismatch , and our lineage of ingenuity , a connection there .
we should have this very challenging , you 'd had n't <unk> or not deny that we should n't try to them to avoid , we need them under the carpeting and return , but it 's about , in the odds of opportunity to recognize .
it 's me , perhaps more about , clear to rise to be adversities , maybe not get to , but that we do open , are , you to hug , and make it <unk> to gather around , even a <unk> to use , and even to dance .
and maybe we make it , the odds , as a natural , coherent and useful to see , and enjoying ourselves that way through their presence , such a huge load .
in this year and celebration needs to the 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he was 150 years ago about evolution has written , did darwin , in my view , on something very true in the human nature and pointed out .
i would it <unk> : not the most powerful its kind of surviving , and also not the <unk> its way , but the to the changes the ict sector can .
of conflicts of creativity .
not only from darwin 's work , we know that the ability of people , to survive and <unk> , the clash of human mind , marmite is , by conflict to turn .
so , again , change and adjusting these are the greatest skills of people .

maybe this is that the point of tremendous odds , a perception of the troubles , a sense of our own power .
we can be so even a gift .
we can be adversities , a new meaning to the tough times beyond all about .
maybe we can odds , when you see the change .
tremendous odds are for a change , at the we have n't have adapted .
i think , the biggest neurological damage , we dethrone ourselves <unk> have , is to believe that we 're normal to be .
let 's face -- who is normal ?
there is not normal .
there 's the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and they would those poor , the gray person who really know how we want , if you really exist ?
i think , actually not .
it would love , if we have this paradigm of normality , fighting another one of the capabilities or the strength to use it 's even a little bit dangerous to ask , exchange being able to . so we can the forces of a lot of kids to release and you to invite men , their very particular , and they’d skills in society that 's a cleverer .
<unk> have found that we humans from the members of our society , one who claimed , useful to be and a contribution to afford .

they have these people not as a broken and useless , outer space ; they were as something special , and strikes get treated .
imagine a few years , i went around the city , i grew up was , in a <unk> in time , `` the red zone . '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there with a <unk> tomato .
it was the summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear , as a guy behind me , `` well , if this is not <unk> <unk> is . ''

and i said , `` sorry , sir , we know ourselves ? i ca n't , you . ''
and he said , `` well , they columnist , hardly at me remind .

oh , so the .
and of course , it , but then they click .
this was dr. <unk> , a man , i just like narratives of my mother about this day i knew , because i think of course , very characteristic , to my birthday , two weeks , too late husband came .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mother was in the holidays , and so i knew my parents the man that me to the world 's got to do n't do .
and because i do n't <unk> was born , and my feet , for them pointing had and i just a couple of the toes , at this and a couple of your toes , at the other foot had it was the <unk> , these strangers to the bad news was a spectacular .
he said to me , `` i had to your parents tell you to do n't run well , and it 's never motionless , would like the other children or that you never a <unk> life by using tape , and since they broke me simply lying <unk> . ''
really extraordinary , i found that he <unk> my entire childhood , collected , however , if i work in a <unk> in the second grade , i 'd won , if i do with the <unk> at the mermaid parade , <unk> road was , however , if i my transplant fellowship , or one of my <unk> <unk> <unk> had , and he was using these clips to his students to teach , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x factor. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . , the potential of willing .
you ca n't enough to emphasize , how critical those underlying factor for the quality of people can be .
and dr. <unk> talked further , he said , `` i 've learned that children , if you do n't always something else said , and even if you just a little grant to get to having kids putting yourself <unk> , then you can teach kids are very much do . ''
you see , dr. <unk> has to think about changing .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone to handle , two different things are .
and i quit my thinking in the course the time has changed , i find myself in the age of 15 years , i 'd asked , if i mean prosthetics than against the legs of meat and bone swapped twitter could have , then i would have no one second <unk> .
i wanted was necessarily be normal work .
if you me that capability to ask , i 'm not so sure .
and that 's happening , because i do with my legs , you 've experienced and not in spite of these experiences .
and perhaps could this change also happen , because i was so many people running into am , my door opened , instead of people to go to me to cut , or me an idea of mechanistic wanted .
you see , it really just a man , you a demo , their powers <unk> can , and they 're going through .
if it 's someone in order to move your own , inner power to activate , -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do that , and for somebody in a critical moment a door opened , you are for those people a very good teachers .
they put them at themselves , and doors to open .
the real importance of the word `` <unk> '' is rooted in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means to bring that in this is , the potential <unk> .
again , which the potential we would like , full-scale ?
in the '60s years was in britain 's a <unk> done . then were <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` <unk> <unk> '' in america is what we call this as `` <unk> . ''
the students going to the notes , divided .

they then , <unk> period of students , `` well enough , '' the top grade , `` very good '' gave them . it was told you , they were <unk> that you very clever would . and after these three months , they really <unk> written .
and of course <unk> it in the core to hear that way around the <unk> was told , they were just enough .
and as it was then after the three months , too .
but only ones that are still in school were -- aside from the students , the school <unk> had .
it was instrumental in this trial were , the teachers wo n't <unk> were .
the teachers who did n't know that something changed was .
they were just told that are the student and that are the students with the note would have enough . and as you have you something about teaching and turn them .

if we do it , but to the human spirit , and helping to continue to hope for themselves , and people out for this nice to find , inquisitive and <unk> to be then we 're using our power is really positive .
if a spirit of those qualities more warm , we can be a new reality and new <unk> do .
i want to a poem end , that by persian poet named <unk> in 14 century . it written by the making my friend , jacques <unk> told them . and the poem called `` the god , the only four words , if you know . '' `` every child labor , not the god the name , not the god the <unk> , but the god , the only four words , if you know , and these are repeated , he says , only time : come to dance with me . ''
come to dance with me . thank you .
