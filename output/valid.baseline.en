you know , one of the big <unk> the trip and one of our delights the <unk> research is , along with the people to live , even at the old days you can remember , the your past , still in the wind will feel , you on the rain <unk> rocks and touch , you in the bitter the leaves the plants ' delicious .
just that you know that <unk> still , beyond the milky way to travel , or the importance of myths , the oldest the inuit -- more full of these are , or that the himalayas and the buddhists and still the breath of <unk> tracking , which means , the root , revelation of physical anthropology research into memory to shout out that 's the idea that the world , we live , not in a total of literal level , just as a model of reality , as a consequence of a group of possibilities of an adaptation of our ancestors , <unk> successful , many generations of chose .
and needless to share , we all the same <unk> .
we 're all born . we teach kids to the world .
we went through <unk> .
we need to the <unk> being separated by the death to engage and so there 's going to us not surprise that we 're singing , dancing and and art , fulfilling this .

and plays it do n't matter , whether it , the <unk> in the forest destruction of borneo , is , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior , <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> right into the sahara . this is just happened in a colleague , with me a month ago in the desert , i went am . or even a <unk> at the hanging of <unk> , everest , the <unk> the world .
all these people teach us that there yet another <unk> , some perfectly , other ways to the orientation in the earth there .
and this is an idea that , if you think about , one with just hope to satisfy it .
together , the infinite number cultures , the world a net of <unk> and cultural life that the earth 's wrapped up and for this is probably the earth as important is what the biological <unk> that as the biosphere , if you know .
you can get this cultural <unk> as a <unk> imagine . <unk> can help when the sum of thoughts and dreams , myths and ideas , of inspirations -- and this intuition , from the human imagination ever since the beginnings of consciousness , generated by to be defined .
the <unk> is the big legacy of humanity .
it 's this symbol of all to what we 're and what we as an amazing <unk> species are able to .
and just like the biosphere , very <unk> was , they did this with the <unk> -- just to even greater our velocity .
no biofluorescent marine biologist would like , dare to say that 50 percent or more all kinds of the brink of extinct we are , there 's just not true . and yet , this -- that <unk> <unk> work on the biodiversity -- equivalent to do n't change the things to us as <unk> <unk> work on the cultural diversity , known .
and the key indicator species for that is extinct in the languages .
than any of them in this room was born , were on the earth are 6,000 different languages spoken language .
now is a language not just the <unk> of <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is the expression of human spirit .
it 's a means , with the soul of a certain cultures are available to the material world finds oneself .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , an inflection point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual and opportunities .
and of that are 6,000 different languages are today , as we 're here in monterey , ostensibly , exactly half of no longer in the ears of children <unk> .

what might be lonely , as the silence wrapped up to be , one of your people to be that your language to talk , no way to have to the wisdom of the ancestors <unk> , or a hopeful that kids to occur ?

and i know that some of you say , it 's not better way ? '' was the world 's not a better place , if we all just a language to be ? '' and i say `` well , let this language , yoruba . let them <unk> be .
let them of kogi . ''
and then they would suddenly realize , how it , i find their own language not could talk .
so i want you today to pay on a trip across the <unk> take away , a quick trip across the <unk> to try to you expected to do , which actually lost .
now there some of us , the sense , forget that i , when i say `` different ways of being , '' truly different ways of being mean .
take them for example , this child the <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , the people the <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from eastern end up in the belly of sacred , snakes <unk> .
this is a disciplined population , which is not being cognitively far between the colored blue , and green is different , there 's <unk> the forest , of people depend on , <unk> is .
they have an idiosyncratic , language and a <unk> the linguistic <unk> is called `` you have to marry someone , that one another language to speak .
all this is rooted in the mythological past . that , idiosyncratic , this big houses , in which one of <unk> six or seven languages spoken to be , but what is that you never find somebody said , that one learned language .
they just hear , and start then to talk .
or , one of the <unk> tribes , with whom i ever i 've lived , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first time in 1958 , peaceful and i contacted by the world .

they threw <unk> pictures of the one of the air down , as a friendly gesture , evaluate them . and forgetting that you that these people from the rainforest in her still never be something <unk> had seen .

but the <unk> killing not just <unk> with the spear .
they <unk> to each other .
54 percent of deaths occur to happen through <unk> .
we followed the <unk> eight generations go back and found two million cases of natural death and when we the people with very forcibly , something about <unk> , gave them to that one of people that old , has been that he 's based on its function has died , and we 're killing him still with the spear .
but while they had a clear -- knowledge of forests , the amazing .
they were hunters who were able to the urine of an animal from 40 steps in distance ever smell and name , which species of theirs .
in the early <unk> years , i was quite an amazing job , when i was my professor in the harvard , he said , if i have to be interested , in haiti , to go and the secret societies to infiltrate the the foundation of the strength of <unk> and <unk> <unk> was and the venom , that for it was used to <unk> to try to make sure .
the way of the ozone chemistry set a sense to give you must naturally i talk about this remarkable think of <unk> know , and <unk> oyster not a cult of the black magic .
in the opposite , it actually , a complex of metaphysical upbeat .
it 's interesting .
if i asked you would , the major religions , on sale , what they would say ?
christianity , islam , in buddhism , <unk> or whatever .
a continent will always <unk> , because the presumption , was , it in sub-saharan africa is n't religious faith to give him . course there was a and <unk> is just that <unk> this very <unk> religious thought that during the tragic diaspora , the <unk> <unk> .
but what <unk> so interesting , is this living connection between the living and the dead .
the living bear the spirits .
the spirit can of them under the big pools <unk> going to respond to the rhythm of the dance to the soul of living in this temporarily , or crowd , so that the <unk> for a short shining right to god will .
<unk> say the <unk> like , `` your white line goes into the church , and say about god .
we use dancing in the temples , and going to god . ''
and because you have been obsessed with you 're going to do you get from the spirit obtained . how you damage <unk> be ?

now , of all of people that i 've met , were of kogi from the sierra nevada and de santa <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> .
the safety , the old <unk> civilization , the <unk> coastal from colombia , most populous , and in a result of conquest , moved out of people in a <unk> <unk> massively back , that about the <unk> coastal smoke .
in a <unk> continent , were these people are the only that never from the <unk> conquered .
to the present day , they get from a <unk> priesthood governed , the training to that priesthood is , is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> be the age of three and four years of their families , separate and in a <unk> world of <unk> , in <unk> at <unk> the glacier , for 18 years to separate . two periods of time , that nine years , deliberately chose to the nine months of pregnancy emulate , they have in my lap , their <unk> mother to contribute to spend so what you <unk> in their lap , the mother .
and during this whole time , they are culturally and in the scores of their society has introduced . values that the claim sustain that your prayers -- and just your prayers of cosmic scene -- or we can say the ecological stewardship -- that balance sustain .
at this amazing <unk> they become one day , to the outside the goods and i first in your life , the age of 18 years , you see a sunrise , and in <unk> moment of consciousness of the first of light , if the sun 's starting on the <unk> the astonishingly beautiful place to radiation , suddenly everything , what they in abstract 've learned in a remarkable feat in pristine glory and confirmed . and the priest kick my back and says , `` you see ? it 's really , i do you 've shared .
it 's so wonderfully . you need to protect . ''
they call the older , brothers and say that we that we the younger , brothers are , for the destruction of the world are responsible .
now this level of intuition is very important .
and if we of aboriginal and the landscape of thinking , <unk> we 're either <unk> and the old one of gossip of fancy , wild <unk> , which in his simplification of a <unk> idea is right hand thoreau and say , these people are more with the natural connection , when we .

it wo n't much space for the <unk> swamps , <unk> or the cold apparently coming from tibet , they have , but nevertheless , through time and the ritual a <unk> <unk> the world shaped , not the idea rests , you 're close to be , but on a far <unk> intuition , the idea that the earth , just existing technology can , because it in the human consciousness <unk> will .
now , which means that ?
it means that a little girl from the andes , in the believe passionately , the mountain in a <unk> is , his or her destiny to control , is a very different person will , and a different relationship to this resource , or this place , as a little girl from montana , in the believe passionately about that 's a mountain under a bunch of stone is , the <unk> can be .
if he had a <unk> of mind or a bunch <unk> is , is irrelevant .
this interesting is the metaphor , which the relationship between the individual and the nature is defined .
i grew up in the forest destruction of <unk> colombia , and i believed that these forests that there are , <unk> to be .
this made me to a different people as my friends of the <unk> , who believe that these forests of <unk> of <unk> and the curved <unk> and the <unk> spirit people are the <unk> the housing , the spirits , you on their <unk> engage them .
now , if you start by the idea to look at that these cultures , various new realities of creating it can , you some of their extraordinary discoveries to understand . for example this plant here .
it 's a picture , that i just last april , in the northwest of the amazon , who accepted .
this is <unk> , of a lot of you 've heard , the most powerful , <unk> from a repertoire of the shaman again .

this plant which includes some very strong <unk> the of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very similar .
if you ever considered the <unk> have seen , this stuff snorting , this substance of them from various ways to create permanent entity which also <unk> .
this <unk> to themselves snorting that 's about how much of a <unk> <unk> to be , <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it 's no distortion of reality does , but the resolution of reality .

but the thing with <unk> is the way that they do n't <unk> held to return , because you through a in the human gut , obviously <unk> enzyme , with names <unk> , <unk> be .
they can only in relationship with some of different chemicals <unk> obtained by the mao <unk> .
now it 's fascinating that the <unk> , in the <unk> are contained , <unk> of exactly the way that are that is necessary to the <unk> to <unk> . you ask , at themselves .
how can these people from a <unk> by 80,000 species <unk> plant these two , morphologically just not related to plant to find the world , on this way , combined , a kind of <unk> version of creating , so that the whole greater than the sum of its parts is ?
we use these great euphemism to try and error , as being meaningless turns out .
but we ask you the indians , they say `` the plant is talking to us . ''
so , which means that ?
this tribe , the <unk> , 17 different varieties of <unk> that they all at great distance in the forest and know , for our eyes , as sort of anti-fashion .
and then ask you , their <unk> arguably , and they say `` i thought , you understand something from plants .
i mean , you know anything ? '' and i said , `` no . ''
so , it turns out that you any of 17 different varieties , <unk> <unk> and they sing to a in a different <unk> .
so , that gives them not a ph.d. in the harvard , but it 's more interesting than <unk> to count .
so , that <unk> the problem is that even those of us , and sympathy with the tricky position of the native people have to them as <unk> and colorful , you know , but somehow the past , shrink , during the real world , meaning , our world , <unk> .
so , the fact is that you look at the 20th century . , in 300 years , not for your war or technological innovation will remember , but rather than at an era , we <unk> was and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity around the earth , either take action , supported them or becoming passive accept . so this problem is not the change .
all cultures have again , the the dance with new <unk> involved .
and the problem is not the technology , in .
the <unk> heard not less on the sioux refused to be , when you must bow and the arrow of jobs , as the americans who stopped americans to be , when you horse and <unk> tasks .
do n't change and technology could threaten the integrity of <unk> . it 's power . that ugly faces the regime .

or if we in the mountains of tibet and go , where i <unk> much haunted by , you that ugly faces the political and dominance .
you know , the genocide that <unk> extinction of people 's general is destined , but the <unk> , the destruction of lifestyle and the people , will not just not charged , but generally , and <unk> as part of <unk> celebrated .
and you can the suffering <unk> n't understand , if you do n't it on <unk> level , we have seen .
i went suddenly engage with a young colleagues got 6,000 of miles of <unk> in <unk> <unk> through <unk> to <unk> and only when i 'm going to <unk> came , i saw the face the statistics from where you hear . 6,000 holy monuments , in the rubble , and ash into being . 1.2 million people that during the cultural melting of the <unk> murdered by .

this meant that it looks at the chinese invasion got killed by the world .
his uncle <unk> with their sanctity of the diaspora , the people to nepal , did .
his mother was locked up , more unusual punishment to -- for the crime as wealthy to be .
he was the age of two years in the prison <unk> to , under your <unk> to hide , because they do without him no life could .
the nurse , these <unk> did <unk> , in a <unk> place .
one day , joined them from this kind of a black armband <unk> and for those <unk> she had to seven years in a heavy camp .
the suffering <unk> can become intolerable be , but the <unk> spirit of people 's something <unk> .
and the end we are really have a choice . we 've set up in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world , the diversity of life ?
margaret mead , the great . anthropologist who said before they died , it their greatest fear is that while we 're in towards a thread , <unk> , of upbeat move , we 're not just the whole range of human imagination at a <unk> way we reduce that would see , but that we one day from a dream to wake up , and i 've forgotten , that 's one of any other ways that there .
and it 's really humbling to go to think that our species , perhaps been over 600,000 years longer exists .
the <unk> revolution , the agriculture ; em , and us that moment , the cult of <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the shaman in terms of his prose the priesthood <unk> and hierarchy , specialization of surplus , created -- it 's happened before , only about 10,000 years , happened .
the modern industrial world as we know it 's hardly see 300 years old .
now , this <unk> history tells me not that we all the answers on the challenges have , which we are in the next few millennia are facing .
if we that infinite number <unk> after the importance of <unk> questions , answering them with 10,000 various voices .

here 's a picture that i 'm at the north end of <unk> wildlife , when i do with <unk> on the <unk> went . and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his <unk> .
the canadian government is not always very well with the inuit handle , and during the <unk> years in the wheat fields of <unk> our regime , they were forced me , settlements , to move .
the grandfather of this old man who refused to go .
the family , the fear to be life was , took him all of guns and all the tools .
now you have to know , the inuit -- not afraid of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
the <unk> their <unk> were originally from fish , in <unk> wrapped up in , technologists .
the grandfather of man , feared , not on the arctic night , or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> to the outside , it caused his pants down from <unk> down and <unk> in his hand . and as the fecal matter to <unk> started , shaped , he them in the form of <unk> .
he <unk> saliva and the sides of <unk> and when it completely frozen was , <unk> he 's a dog with .

so you can come from nothing to do something .
and this is on multiple ways a symbol of the resistance of the inuit -- and all indigenous park in the world .
the canadian government had the inuit -- in april 1999 , the complete control of an area again , that 's bigger than california , texas , together .
it 's our new homeland , and i mean <unk> .
it 's a <unk> area . they control all <unk> .
an amazing example , as a nation , a state , atoning with its vastness of search and achieve it .
and ultimately , i think , it 's pretty obvious , at least for those of us , to these distant aim for the globe went are , to realize that they do n't get away .
they are the <unk> from someone else .
they represent the parts of human imagination , in times past <unk> . and for all of us to be the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children in the geography of hope .
what we do with national geographic and ultimately , trying to do is that we believe that politicians ever do anything .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> no conclusive , is , but we believe that storytelling and the world can change and so we 're probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website , you get 35 million <unk> every month .
156 nations to send our tv channel .
our journals are , read .
and we take a series of travel in the <unk> , which we are our audience to places of such as cultural and amazed to take that she 's lots of that vibrate in <unk> be . and hopefully , they become one after another , the root , revelation of physical anthropology , suppose : that this world 's made , on different ways to exist , we have a <unk> in a really very multicultural <unk> world can find them , the wisdom of all people to our shared and well-being we can contribute .
thank you .
what you -- i first , as soon as possible , you 'll see , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we microsoft , as part of <unk> ago exactly one year to vomit . this is <unk> . and it 's an environment , either you locally , right away with huge amounts of visual information can deal .
we see many , gigabytes of digital photographs here , you will seamlessly , and flaws <unk> , pan , on any way to make arrangements that .
and it 's no matter , how many of information we look , how large that collections , or are about how the images .
the most of you 're using digital entrepreneurship , a camera , but this is for example , a cat scan of the <unk> and it 's in one area of 300 <unk> .
it does n't matter , because the only what the performance of the system like this is constrained can , is the number of <unk> on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible , architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> random house of <unk> . any <unk> is a chapter .
to prove that it , really about a text and not to a picture is , we can be about how do that they to really show that 's an actual representation of <unk> and not an image is .
maybe this is an artificial way , a <unk> to read .
i would it does n't recommend .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of <unk> .
and that gives you really the enjoyment and the good experience of a real <unk> a magazine , or a newspaper to read , which , in a kind of medium with several scales .
we also something on the corner of these special edition of the guardian did .
we have a false ad with very high <unk> designed that much higher than with a good ad is , and we 've added the content , added .
if you the features of cars look like , they can see here .
or different models , or even technological <unk> .
and these pathways , really those ideas on , these constraints , it available social space on screen <unk> .
we hope that we do n't <unk> and other nonsense over means -- that should n't need to be .
obviously this is that mapping of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i 'd like this really do n't spend time , except to say that we also to this area that contribute to be .
but these are all roads in the <unk> .
<unk> the top of <unk> picture of the nasa .
now , let 's now something else out .
now that 's actually live in the internet . it can <unk> .
this is a project with the name <unk> that 's really two different technologies together .
the one is <unk> and the other is a very good the research <unk> that , noah <unk> , a <unk> the university of washington , under the advice from steve <unk> at the <unk>
and rick <unk> from microsoft research , and did was . a very good together .
so this is live in the internet . it 's kind of <unk> driven .
you can see that , if we see this kind of views of creating , where we went through imagery to penetrate , and that experience the <unk> <unk> do .
but the spatial orientation that the imagery is here in fact of meaning .
the <unk> have these pictures together , lasted so you the real space , where this footage that all in near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian rockies been led to be equivalent . you see pieces of <unk> slides , or <unk> <unk> and these things were all in perspective in the frames , put it .
i 'm not sure , whether indeed , i 've been you very different environments to show .
there are thought that much would be spatialized to .
i 'd allograft donor one of <unk> pieces of noah had to show and this is from early prototype of <unk> the the we came in summer , have worked out to give you that 's going to what i believe that 's really the punch behind this technology , the <unk> is . and this is not so obvious , the environments , consider that we the website .
we had to us all the lawyers , etc . concerned about .
this is a <unk> the cathedral <unk> lady , the only in the computer with images from flickr <unk> . give you just <unk> lady in the flickr , and they 're taking pictures of men in my t-shirt and the <unk> etc . get . each of those colored orange <unk> represents a picture that as to this model <unk> was discovered .
so these are all <unk> , and they 're standing in perspective on this way in the frames .
and we can be in this very simple way to navigate .
. you know , i 've never believed that i end up at microsoft 're going .
i 'm very grateful for the reception in here .
. i suspect , you can see that many different kinds of cameras are : it 's doing , of the <unk> to professional <unk> , quite a number of them , all in this environment <unk> were .
and when they can , i 'm a couple of weird to find .
many of you 're from their faces covered , etc .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- there are you .
this is actually a poster of <unk> lady , that really captured by the world .
we can of the poster to a physical view of their configurations .
the point is this is , things with the social environment , and then it can . it will now data from all gathered together -- from the whole collective , memory of the way , visual at the world looks -- and everything is connected .
all these photographs are connected , and it is something that 's bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that from around the earth emerged .
consider , that as the sequel of labor of professor stephen <unk> of virtual earth .
and this is something that through the complexity , with the people 's used to grow and its use for the user , with the app is always gets bigger .
their own photos are going to have metadata <unk> , the one another person has entered it .
if , in the trouble has done and all that saint of them identified , and <unk> , who you are and it 's my photo of the <unk> <unk> suddenly , with all these data , held and i can you as a starting to use around in this space to dive , in this <unk> , the photos of the other people use and so a kind of <unk> <unk> social experience with the use of the other players doing .
and of course , the byproduct of all of the people are intensely with money , virtual models of any interesting part of earth , not just by <unk> or a satellite and so on keeping fires become , but through collective , memory .
thank you .
. i do you right ? their software has given that to a certain stage , in our next year , all images , from someone in the world together to be used in principle , linked together to be ?
yes . she does nothing more than finding out .
if you want to make them to hyperlinks , between the slides .
and she does this because of content in the slides .
and this is really exciting , you look at the amount of semantic information i think that many of these images have .
as if you a <unk> to pictures assessment , where they got the airline and the text on the site itself contains a lot of information about , which is this is .
but what about it , if this picture of them with all their pictures , linked data ?
then is the circumference of semantic <unk> and the wealth , basically raises , really enormous . it 's a shoo-in classic <unk> .
<unk> , it 's really incredible , congratulations .
they thank you .
i 'll tell you some things from my book about the one , i hope , in unison with other things are you have heard . and i 'm trying to a couple of connections to create , if you this is n't have noticed .
i want to start with , what i call `` the official dogma binding . '' i call .
the official dogma of what ?
the official <unk> of all western industrialized societies .
the official dogma in it 's so , when our goal is to maximize the of civic our government is , about this was mostly through the <unk> the freedom of individuals .
the reason this is that freedom , in yourself is good , valuable to make sense , a <unk> requirement for the human .
if human freedoms they do , it 's all of us for yourself to the things to do that our common good to maximize and nobody has to us to decide .
the way of freedom to maximize that 's a choice to maximize that .
ever more choices , people have , gets more free , you have . and more free , they have , gets more common good did you .
this is , i think , so deep-seated in our supply of evolutionary psychologists , it any of on purpose was coming it to ask questions .
and it 's also deeply into our lives is rooted in .
i 'll tell you some examples give to us modern economic development is possible .
this is my supermarket . not a big .
i 'd just briefly about <unk> say .
there than 175 <unk> in supermarkets , if you the 10 different extra <unk> n't <unk> and 12 <unk> that they buy it could make a large number of your salad <unk> make the <unk> case , no idea that the 175 cases in the shop for them is true .
so that 's what the supermarket .
and then they 're going to the <unk> business , a to got reflects -- some speakers , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , <unk> . and in a surplus electronics in business , there are so many <unk> facilities .
we can <unk> millions of different <unk> facilities guest editor of the components that in a business are offered .
you must admit that 's a large selection is .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time , when i was a boy was given that you could every phone , hosts have the you wanted to carry it , ma bell who arrived .
they have your phone <unk> . they have it <unk>
a result was , the phone ever broken .
these days are over .
we 've now almost an infinite selecting on telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile the future .
and my favorite is the in the center -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> torch around .
and they to this yet still not in your business and i 've seen , you can be sure that it 's going to be .
and what it does it 's going to help people do in the business to go and this question to ask .
you know now what the answer that question is ?
the answer is `` no . ''
it 's not possible a cellphone , to buy that 's not too much does .

health -- it 's no longer the case in the united states that you for a ph.d. 's go and the doctor says , you what to do .
instead they 're going to the doctor and the doctor says , you : why we have a to make or we could plan b .
those who has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what you want to do ?
and they say , `` doctor , what should i do ? ''
the doctor says , b has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what you want to do ?
and if you say , `` if you i would , doc , what would you do ? ''
the doctor says , `` but i 'm not you . ''
the result is -- we call it `` patient , autonomy . '' in this sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shifting the burden of responsibility for the meeting of decisions of someone to know , saudi the doctor -- to explore the n't know , and likely 's ill and therefore , it in the constitution , is a choice to meet -- in saudi the patient .
there 's a tremendous marketing , for <unk> drug for people like you and me , that , if you 're going to think any sense , because you do n't buy .
why this force them around us , if we 're not able to buy ?
the answer is : you expect from us the doctor in the next morning <unk> and a to change the prescription to ask .
something like <unk> how our identity is now an issue of choice , like this slide show you do .
we heir not an identity , we invent it .
and we reinvent ourselves as often new way we want .
that means that every day , if you the morning , wake up , they 're forced to , what a kind of person you can be like .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time , in the <unk> was , almost every one had and the way you get married soon as you could , and then so easily kids were as you could .
the only true that election was `` who '' , not any day , and not what they keep doing .
nowadays everything is easy to have .
i teach , wonderful intelligent , students , and i leave you 20 percent less effort and when i once did .
and that 's not because they 're less sense are , and not because they are more carefully .
it 's because it with other things are engaged , you ask yourself , `` should i married , or not ? should i 'm going to marry ?
should i later , marry ? should i just have kids , or just been doing ? ''
that are all <unk> questions .
and they 're going to this question answering those if that means that all the tasks to do that i do you <unk> and no good note in my class , to get .
and in fact , they to do this . these are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we 're blessed , as carl shows , with the undergraduate that allows us every minute of every day of any place on planet to work -- the way on the <unk> hotel .
there are actually a corner , of the i any , i 'm going to the <unk> works .
i 'm going to do n't tell you , because i use it wants .
so what it , this extraordinary freedom of choice we have in terms of choices to meet , and again , and again , if we have to work or not have to work .
we can make our kids at the football games to look , and we have our mobile phone in a hip , and our blackberry , at the other hip , and our laptop is probably going on their lap .
and even if they shut these are , every minute us in our child at <unk> of <unk> <unk> we ask ourselves as well , `` i tried to this call to assume ?
i should be in this email answers ? i should devote this letter writing ? ''
and even if the answer to the question `` no , '' is that 's going to be sure your experience of <unk> your kid , cloaking them very different than it would ever .
everywhere , where we look closely , great things and little things that material things and lifestyle , life is an issue of choice .
and the world , we lived , he looked like .
so i want to say , there are choices , but not it was an issue of choice .
and the world , we 're living like .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is `` aye . ''
we all know what good thing is , so i 'm about what 's bad thing is .
all this fund have two effects , two or negative effects on people .
an effect , <unk> way , this is that he paralyzed , as opposed to remove themselves .
with so many options out , you choose to find it people very hard to do to decide .
i 'm going to them another one <unk> example , going to a study about investing in private voluntary <unk> .
a colleague of mine had access to <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> from about one million u.s. employees and i think about . 2,000 people different jobs .
and what they found was living every 10 <unk> of the private employer , slickest , took the ticket to two percent .
they 're offering 50 <unk> on -- 10 percent less than their employees are taking part of as if you just five to flourish , dignity . why ?
because it 50 <unk> are the selection are , it 's hard to decide what you choose to that it 's the morning , and delayed .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow 's obviously never .
you know that 's not just means that people <unk> need to eat when they come in retirement go , because they 're not enough money to make his have , it also means that make decisions that hard is that she wields great <unk> her employer to miss .
by the not participating . give them to 5,000 u.s. dollars per year on the <unk> , the happy one would their contributions to reproduce .
that paralysis , is a consequence of too many options .
and i think it tends to the world looks like .
they like the decision really hit , if it for all eternity is , right ?
they do n't want the wrong and investment fund them , or even the fake <unk> .
so this is an effect . the other secondary effect is that even if we that paralysis , over , and make a decision to finish us less happy with the result of the selection , as , if we the opportunity had we have brought us between a few ways to decide .
and there 's several reasons for this .
one of them is contingent upon by the large selection of different <unk> , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect -- and , which <unk> 's been perfect ? it 's easy to imagine that she 's a different decision , you can meet the better would ever . and what happens is this rough sulfates alternative which leads to you to the decision to regret , and that we regret that looks a negative impact on the average happiness , you , has remained the decision was , even if it 's a good choice .
more opportunities there , gets easier , it 's anything to regret that 's very disappointing for the choice that they meet .
secondly , what economists <unk> call .
dan , gilbert 's a big one morning , made by was telling how much the way , we evaluate things , it 's due to what we do it 's compare .
well , if it 's a lot of alternatives to think there , it 's easy , attractive properties of thinking of alternatives that they exclude , that makes them less happy with the alternatives that they voted .
here 's an example . for the rest of them , no new york are , apologize for me .
but here is , what they would have thought should .
here 's a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
gorgeous embodiment of the beach . great day . they have it 's all for yourself .
what could be better ? `` damn ! '' the man who thinks , `` it 's august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood , is gone .
i could in front of my house park . ''
and he spend two weeks of the thought that tracks that he is the possibility of missed , day of the day , a blemish on the parking lot to have .
<unk> reduce the average happiness that we created by our sample from now , well , if that what we chose to have a fantastic .
and more opportunities to put it 's selection , there , gets more attractive properties of selection are in the <unk> account .
here 's one another example .
now , this cartoon is doing some statements .
he makes a statement about the now to live and maybe about things are starting to do .
but a big point , he does is : whatever people who you for one thing to decide to decide , the other things not to do .
and these other things like many , attractive properties have , and it will , they 're going to be more appealing to do .
three : <unk> the expectations .
this , i met , when i my jeans exchange wanted .
i 'm wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in it just designer jeans is a way , and they have bought it , and they 're bad <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and if you long enough housewife and often enough to be bathed had , they started , `` ok , '' <unk> .
so i was about new jeans , to buy after many years of <unk> the old , and i said , `` i 'd like a few jeans , here 's my size . ''
and the sales , `` you want to lean people , easy <unk> right whales ?
you want to do buttons , or <unk> ? rock or an acid bathed in ?
you want jeans and with holes ?
you like there 's too far to cut , <unk> , blah ... '' and so forth and he told .
my jaw was down and after i started rebounding , i said , `` i 'd like the way , the past the only way . ''

i did it better . all these choices that allowed it to me that 's better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book , to try it myself to explain .
the reason that i got worse , i felt was , with all this available social choices , and expectations do , which for a few jeans is what makes us , went up .
i was very low expectations . i did not a concrete expectations , as it , in a kind there .
when you in a hundred species that came to damn well , one of you would be perfect paper should ,
and what i got was fine , but it was n't perfect .
and so i compared me what i had received to of what i expected , and what i was very disappointing results in comparison to of what i expected .
this add of opportunities in the lives of people increases that inevitably the expectations of people have about how great opportunities that will be .
and this leads to sort of satisfaction with the results , the results .
nobody in the world of sexy , i know this . because , if it would , you knew what they 're not what it 's about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that used everything was better than anything bad basketball was , than anything bad basketball was , it was for the people could experience to make the a pleasant surprise was .
now , in the world , we live -- we 're wealthy , the industrialized citizens , to perfection than expecting -- the best for that you ever hope that 's the things are so good as you do it of you expect .
they 'll never really comfortable by surprise . because your expectations , and expectations , <unk> .
the secret to <unk> -- that 's what they all of lawsuits are -- the secret to <unk> are low expectations .
i 'd say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i 'd be a woman got married , i am , and it 's really beautifully .
i 'd let 's not much we can do . i do n't culturing bacteria .
but <unk> is not always like a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of <unk> a bad , squatting jeans and if it only one way to get there is that if you surely those are , and they 're wondering why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what would you can do ?
if hundreds of different types of jeans are available , and they buy a kind of very disappointing is , and they 're wondering why , who is responsible for ?
it 's also clear that the answer to the question is , you .
they would it better , can do .
with a hundred different kinds of jeans and in <unk> , there 's no excuse for error .
and so , when people make decisions , and even if the results make decisions are good , feel you feel keenly disappointed about , they 're blaming yourself .
clinical depression have exploded in the industrial world in the past generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only , but a <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also the suicide , this is that people who 've learned in the very disappointing are because their standards , so high . and then , if you these experiences himself will tell you have , think it would your fault .
and that 's <unk> it to us , generally better go , objective , and we 're bad feeling .
so , let me if you .
this is the official dogma for that one that we all for right up , completely false . it 's not true .
there 's no doubt that some selection is better than not , but it follows not , that more selection is better than some selection .
there 's a magical lot . i do n't know what it 's .
i 'm pretty sure that we that long did i miss the the sample of our common good long way .
now , as a policy question -- i am almost finished -- as a policy question , the thing about the thinking is . that what these are choosing to send in the industrialized societies , is the material that wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we went from a lot of you 've heard that problem is not the too large selection is .
your problem is that she 's too much .
so the things , i 'm telling you 're an odd thing with the modern , rich , western societies .
and what 's as frustrating , frustrated and is : steve levitt , you yesterday about talks about how this is more expensive and hard to <unk> <unk> n't help . it 's a waste of money .
what i 'm telling you is that these high-end brands , complicated patient choices -- it 's not just that they do n't help .
they 're actually hurt .
they worry about it that we got worse , standing there .
if something else from what the people in our society has given that decision to come to the societies in which people too little sample 've shifted their dignity , would not only that live in the people increases , but we would also be improved .
economists call this one <unk> application .
<unk> going to worry that everybody 's better go -- not just the poor -- because all these large selection of us <unk> .
finally , reading you ask this cartoon , and , a sophisticated person , says , `` ah ! what you know this fish ?
you know it as possible in this <unk> . ''
<unk> imagination , a shortsighted , the way the world -- and that 's the way i do it 's first i 've read .
more , i 've been thinking about , gets more i came to the sole , that the fish , that you know .
because the truth is that if you that <unk> break , so that it 's possible , you have no individual liberty . they have that paralysis within .
if you that <unk> break , so that it 's possible to cut them the average happiness .
they 're stepping out of paralysis and reduce the average happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost a consummate security to be limited -- perhaps even for the fish , absolutely attenuate for us .
but that <unk> be a metaphorical <unk> is a recipe for likewise , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i think about some of these projects before talking , over the genome and what that could mean , and over the discovery of the groups of genes .
actually start to a new point : we have the biology and digitized , and now we try to make digital code in a new phase of biology to get them , so we new life create , and build .
we have been trying to great questions to ask .
what 's life ? it 's something , which i believe that many biologists have tried to understand and this in a different levels .
we have different approaches tried to put it up on the minimum of the components to simplify them .
we have nearly 20 years of digitized . when we that <unk> have sequenced <unk> , the transition from the analog world of biology to digital world the computer .
now we 're trying to be asking whether we live regenerate , or whether we new life to create , because of digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , the mycoplasma <unk> , the smallest genome of a species has to yourself in the lab to replicate it . and we tried to see if we that , even smaller genome to achieve .
we 've done it up about a hundred genes to get rid of the 500 , or so that i 'm here .
but if we those metabolic map , you the very simple is , relative to our . trust me , this is straightforward . but if we all those genes to see that we one after another , eliminating needless to it 's very unlikely that this to a living cell , where dignity .
so we decided that 's the only way ahead to is that chromosome in order to synthesize , which allows us to the individual elements to <unk> and so a couple of the fundamental question to ask .
and so we started working on with the question , we can a chromosome , synthesize patterns ?
it 's allowed the chemistry inside this really big molecule to create , which have never been done before ?
and , if we can do that , we make sure that chromosome start ?
a chromosome , is the way , just a piece <unk> chemical material .
our actions at the very high-res digitization , of life were growing exponentially .
our ability of genetic code to write , evolving very slowly but nevertheless , increased . and our final point was going on an exponential curve . come .
we 've got 15 years ago started .
and it actually a few years with posing a <unk> review , before we the first experiments that made .
how the zoning concept is <unk> very difficult .
there are tens of machines that around the world 's the little pieces of dna can manufacture , 30 to 50 letter a long , but it 's a <unk> process , so the longer you a piece of power , the more error happen .
so we had a new way to come up with the we are those pieces together and the error correct the situation .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital data , of the genome phi x 174 countries .
it 's a virus that the bacteria , kill .
so we made a little pieces , making an <unk> and had a dna molecule of approximately 5,000 letters .
the exciting to phase , came when we did this piece <unk> chemical to take and in a bacterium , gave me , and that bacteria turned into the genetic code to read and went viral particles .
the viral particles that were then of the cells declassified , and they came back and killing the chuck e. coli .
recently i did with the <unk> speaking , and they said that you this model that <unk> .
they were laughing , more than her , it 's doing .
so we think that 's a situation is in the software in fact that your hardware we can build in a biological systems .
but we wanted more to move forward . we wanted a whole management <unk> chromosome , building . it has more than <unk> ability to be genetic code . so we thought , we build it in tapes , from the size of the virus , what we the size of tapes <unk> able to understand what the individual elements of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you with digital content in the computer to start to have this digital content really all accurate .
when we the genome -- came in 1995 , have sequenced has been the <unk> at a mistake per 10,000 pairs .
we found the <unk> 30 mistakes . if we the original sequence to use it would it would never been possible <unk> .
a part of design is it , cut up to create the 50-percent owner of letters for are and the with other <unk> pieces overlap . need to get smaller <unk> to build with that fit together .
we have a unique elements there is built .
you might have heard that we <unk> built .
you think about : we have a <unk> code : b , c , g and t .
<unk> these letters -- these letters actually encode about 20 amino acids , and there 's one polynesian for each of these amino acids .
so we can the genetic code using to our words , to write sentences , thoughts .
initially we only signed .
some people who was disappointed about that 's not enjoy poetry was .
we have the pieces constructed so that we 're just with what enzymes , break seen . there are enzymes , this repair and to stitch back .
and we have begun to cut up to create , starting with pieces of the coupled with up <unk> letters <unk> , lets take this line up to <unk> to make this around them back to self-assemble , to <unk> .
in every step , we have these pieces in the surplus in order to do we sequence them were able to because we looked at a very robust process to create what they were in a minute , i 'll see .
we tried to the period of <unk> to get .
so that looks like a <unk> .

we knew from a mechanism of <unk> recombinations to call it 's going to the biology is used to dna to fix that these pieces to stitch can .
here 's an example of them . there 's an organism is called <unk> <unk> the three million cycle of light that survived .
you see in the upper field to be a chromosome , just unpack that fell .
12 to 24 hours later , , it all over again that brought it was like .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can totally <unk> going to you can even in a vacuum life .
i 'm totally certain that live in space there , and you can move , the lookout for <unk> conditions .
indeed , the nasa has shown that 's lots of them out there are .
here 's a <unk> of the molecule that we made have to do this math processes that have used -- actually we only <unk> used to the right design the pieces we 're <unk> . yeast <unk> these then automatically comes together .
this is not <unk> it 's a regular of .
it 's a big molecule is , it even with the <unk> can see .
that are pictures of the duration of six seconds .
this is the <unk> that we just recently finished have asked .
that are about <unk> letters of <unk> code . it 's the largest molecule to <unk> structure that any of people who was created .
it has a <unk> from over 300 million .
if we a <unk> of 10 and without the distances of print ? what would it <unk> sides of military budgets , just about this genetic code <unk> .
now , how to start to a chromosome out ? how we activate it ?
obviously this is that it with a virus , very simple . it 's more complicated with bacteria to deal .
it 's also be easier if you see it in <unk> how we there are doing : you just take the nucleus out and there is a different business , and this is that 's exactly what they all over the clones have heard .
in <unk> is that chromosome into the cells integrated , but recently we have shown that you have a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another risk assessment can go and turn it .

this new synthetic chromosome out went into the cell .
indeed we thought that 's the end is , but we tried the process that i 'm going to bring .
this is the <unk> the evolution , here .
we find all kinds of species here , a second , the chromosome , taken , or a third of <unk> , every time , thousands of the characteristics , just a second to a species <unk> .
people so , evolution can imagine that as a gene that to a moment changed will have a lot of the biology is missing .
there are enzymes are the <unk> be called the fact , dna and digest .
that chromosome out that in the cell was has neither of the chromosomes , we added to have already .
it was in the cell <unk> and i realized that other synthetic chromosome , as alien material <unk> it and so we had the end just a cell with a new synthetic chromosome .
it <unk> , blue , because of the genes that we added had .
and after a very short time i did it all the characteristics of species , however , and <unk> completely in a new species , based on the new software that we in the cell production capability .
all these proteins that period of the membranes , shifted to -- when we the genetic code , read , it was that 's exactly what we <unk> have .
it may be like the genomic <unk> sound , but we can , by we the <unk> shift , things quite dramatic change .
now i argued that it 's not the <unk> is -- the consequence of 3.5 billion years of evolution
and i argued that we might help you 're a new kind of the cambrian explosion to create in it 's massive new <unk> based on this digital media design might be .
why should we do that ?
i think it 's pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we 're out of four to nine billion people in the next 40 years <unk> .
about it into my relationship to ask : i was in <unk> born .
today are three people on this planet for each of in <unk> exists , it 's inside of 40 years , it 's four cancer .
we have problems with the foods , with all-natural fresh and clean water , medicine , the fuel , to 6.5 billion people .
it 's a challenge that for nine to offer .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion <unk> oil . that are a hundred million <unk> day .
if we of biological processes to think , or any industry takes to bring that replace , it 's a huge challenge .
then , of course , there 's all the co2 from this material that in the atmosphere 's landing .
we 've now , from our discoveries from around the world , a database , about 20 million of genes , and i want to believe that the <unk> the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and you see the diversity of the came out .
we hit here , primarily on the frontiers of biological reality and at the ones our imagination .
we 've now technologies that kind of avoided <unk> , to bring that do what we <unk> genetics .
we 've now the possibility of a large humanoid robot to build the millions of chromosomes , the day can create .
if you imagine those 20 million of the various genes to make or those evolutionary processes to optimize the octane make or drugs new vaccines , we can do with a just small team over a molecular biology to change as the last 20 years of science .
and it 's just <unk> selection . we 're able to <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals , or <unk> <unk> and so forth .
this is a shot of cartoon lover <unk> , we 're working with the you actually sit and new species on the computer , manufactured <unk>
you know , we do n't exactly how it will look . we know exactly how their genetic code looks that will .
we focus so the fossil fuels the fourth generation .
they have recently , corn to be ethanol , which simply a bad tv experiment .
we have fuels the <unk> and third generation of relatively quickly come to the much higher <unk> have to be like octane fuel or different kinds of <unk> .
but , how we think , the only way to biology is a big impact , having another spike in the cost on food or the reduction of the availability that will have is , if we added co2 as starting material can see , and so we 're working on the cells that go ,
and we think that we the first with <unk> the fourth generation will be , and that in about 18 months .
the sunlight and co2 are a method --
but -- in our discovery of the world , we all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism , we 1996 , described .
he lives in the deep , about <unk> miles deep , at virtually <unk> <unk> .
it converts co2 in the methane to under the use of hydrogen as a source .
we study whether we <unk> co2 we can use , which simply to <unk> brought to be able to <unk> the co2 in the fuel cell to this process of power .
within a short , we think , we could the capacity to be one of basic questions of life to solve .
you know , we really -- <unk> ambitions as the risk control all across the petrochemical industry . exactly what if you that 's not at ted i could do , where else ? a <unk> the energy to be .
but as we work currently working very , the same two approaches to the development of vaccines to use .
they have it this year with the flu had seen , we 're always a year , back off and have a dollar , little bit , if it to the right vaccine .
i think that changed to be able to you <unk> vaccines , in <unk> .
this is it , like the future , possibly could look up with changes , can now the <unk> speeds are dealing with synthetic one bacteria , <unk> , and prim <unk> .
we are light years of them to remove humans to improve . our goal is it 's only that we have a chance long enough to survive to that potentially to do . thank you .
on the last ted conference room gave me an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come to me to explain how the machine works .
now , it 's so far . and for all those who did n't there were , the lhc is the largest scientific experiments which has ever being addressed by -- 27 more miles in diameter .
his job is it , the conditions to create , which fewer than a <unk> second , after dawn of the universe already existed -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it 's just the breathtaking , ambitious .
this is the machine is transforming from in geneva .
we 're taking pictures of <unk> in the detectors on .
at that i work . he is the atlas of the detector , and 44 feet in the width , 22 feet in diameter .
here 's a spectacular picture of atlas off in the construction , so you the <unk> see .
at 10 . september the last year around the machine , i first time .
and this picture was from an atlas of recorded .

it 's a picture of the first <unk> which the route around the lhc <unk> , then we intentionally off with a part of the lhc <unk> to a rain from the particles in the detector <unk> to cancer .
in other words , when we made this at 10 . september they saw , we knew that the machine works , what a huge victory .
i do n't know , whether this is the biggest <unk> generated , or this , when someone the google site went and the front page , so i found .
it means that we have a cultural difference the side of science of trade .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine thinking up with these <unk> here to do was -- this golden wires wrapped up here .
those wires , guiding <unk> <unk> when the machine on <unk> process .
now , the engineers of you will you look and say , `` no that they do n't . that are little piano wires . ''
you can that payment , because if you very far <unk> , they going to call <unk> .
at minus <unk> degrees , cooler than the space between the stars , can see those wires in the tension , goodness .
in the connections , between the <unk> magnets used in the lhc , there was a <unk> .
it would have heating , the wires , which is slightly and <unk> <unk> met and suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was the outcome .
now , all this is still <unk> if you imagine that the magnet about 20 tons drop down and the globe about . 30 inches of shifting .
we are damaged , so about 50 the magnet
and they had to remove , what we also did .
we <unk> you start again , <unk> you .
they 're now all back on its way back .
against the march , is the lhc , again <unk> be .
we 're going to him <unk> , and expecting the first data in june , or maybe july , we 're able to change , and put our journey on to figure out what the building blocks of the universe .

i think the fact that it 's worth , the fact that we about our barriers , beyond our grasp , forming the value of things like the lhc .
i 'm going to my final element of words in english scientist devices , humphrey <unk> , the one , i suspect , when he 's the most useless experiments of his <unk> defended itself , his student was michael <unk> , here , `` nothing is such dangerous for the evolution of human mind , when i assume that our scientific ideas <unk> are that 's no mysteries in nature is that our triumphs <unk> are , and that 's no new worlds to seize that there . ''
thank you .
i 'm a writer .
books to write this is my profession , but it 's natural more than that .
it 's also my big , a lifetime of love and fascination .
and i do n't expect to that ever change is .
but it 's recent study some weird in my life and my career has happened that helped me to it has bought , my reference to this work perfectly to rethink together .
this be idiosyncratic incident was , i recently wrote a book i 've -- a biography called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- that , i decided to different than all my previous books from stealing other reasons in the world every expectation , and a big <unk> , international <unk> was .
the result is that i do n't matter where i come to treat it 'll just as if i the crashing <unk> .
seriously -- the crashing <unk> !
for example , they come up very concerned up to me and say , afraid that they do n't mean that you that success never by 2027 be ?
they have no fear that they all their lives <unk> and never again a book put together , that <unk> in the world 's very much ? never again ? ''
okay , that do the courage .
it would be however , worse , when i do n't remember that would that i 'm going over 20 years , when i was a teenager i first of them told me to a writer , wanted to be , with the same kind of <unk> always been faced am .
the people said , `` you 're not afraid , never succeed , to have ?
you no fear that you the humiliation of rejection killing ?
you ai n't afraid you to the craft , your life for <unk> and so we 've never thing occurs and you to be on a <unk> <unk> dreams are dying were going -- your mouth is filled with the bitter ash of failure to get ?
so roughly , you know .
the answer -- the short answer on these questions is : <unk>
yes , i worry about all this thing .
and the year i always .
and i was a lot more things that fear that nobody <unk> would .
how the algae , and other <unk> things .
but if it 's listening to write about and i think in recent years about it , and ask me : why ?
it 's reasonable that ?
it 's obvious that by someone 's expected to be that it in fear has to work to do to the he proved to invoke `` you feel ?
and what exactly the creative watch off you to us secure coding over the `` reciprocal apparition in making -- in a way that 's other professions have n't do ?
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i can look at me any situation in 40 years as a chemist who remember , he was asked , if he feared would , chemist to be .
with your <unk> , john -- how it away from you do ?
it did n't , you know ?
but to be fair to be -- the group of the chemist who have the centuries , not the reputation of <unk> <unk> people get .
we author who seem , but this kind of the reputation . but not just the writer , but the creative of genres , they seem like this call to have mental stature , unstable .
everything , they 're going to , is , the bitter <unk> of really great minds in itself from the 20th century . watch , the young and a lot of their own hand , died .
and even the ones do n't actually <unk> <unk> , the tracks from their talent that , neglected and been to be .
norman <unk> said before he died in his last job interview , <unk> my books , i was a little further <unk>
an extraordinary point , you about your entire oeuvre . can do .
but we shrug n't even , if we 're anything like to tell you hear , because we of these statements for such a long time you know , somehow we have the notion that her bones and collective expression of acceptable that creativity and tired of course <unk> and that art -- the end -- i used to <unk> lead .
the question that i 'm going to anyone here to ask you want is : is this idea for them completely in order ?
you feel , so i guess ? because with only one inch by far you look -- i feel with this notion not comfortable .
i think it such irate .
and i think it 's dangerous . and i do n't want to watch how to them into the next century were adopted by .
i think it 's better , if we of creative encourage to live .
and i know definitely , it for me -- in my particular situation -- very dangerous to be able to start , this dark path of the presumption , <unk> -- especially in the situation , i 'm on in my career at that puts it .
that means -- you see : i 'm very young . i 'm only about . 40 years old .
i 've probably another 40 <unk> in me .
and it 's extremely unlikely that everything , what i from now on writing , i 'm from the world as the work score is , after the <unk> success of my last book came , right ?
i say it comes straight , because we 're here , you 're sort of friends -- it 's highly unlikely that my greatest triumph of behind me lie .
oh , jesus , which for a thought !
that are sort of the idea that somebody to be able to 9 a.m start , <unk> to drink . and that i want to do n't .
i would prefer to continue this work to do that i love .
so is the question : how ?
eventually , of <unk> strikes me that i 'm going to continue to write , a kind of <unk> psychological construct design must .
somehow i have from now to find a way , when you write a safe distance to real disjunction between me and my very natural <unk> of how the responses on the very well-written will be .
i was in the last year after the models for looking to have to get to do this , i also in the past , looking and i tried to other societies have to find , to see , if you might better or <unk> ideas about it had as we , how creativity can help , with the emotional and risk more kindly , it , creativity are connected .
this quest just ushered me into the ancient greece and the ancient rome .
please join me , because the circle were going to go back to close .
but in ancient greece and rome have the people do n't believe that creativity of people coming , okay ?
they believed that creativity is a sort <unk> <unk> was , from a remote , and unknown source of the most people coming -- from <unk> , and unknown reasons .
the greeks called this mortal <unk> of creativity <unk> .
from socrates is known that he 's what i thought , he had one <unk> , he <unk> out on the distance , i delivered .
the romans had the same idea , we call this kind of <unk> creative spirit of a <unk> .

they believed that a genius , this kind of magic <unk> beings who was that did was that 's literally pushed into the walls of <unk> lives -- like <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artists in the work in a sense of invisible <unk> and the result of labor to throw it would .
that 's brilliant , there is it , there 's the distance , of the i talked about -- the psychological construct the watch out of the following your work to protect .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artists of <unk> was certain things are protected , like , for example , too much <unk> , right ?
if your work , brilliant was outs , you 're not all look for you deduct . everybody knew you to this <unk> genius , until that you helped them .
if your work <unk> -- not entirely , your fault , right ?
everybody knew , your moral genius did something <unk> .
so we have the people in the west really long time about creativity thought .
and the renaissance and all changed . we had this great idea . and this great idea was : let 's the human individual into the center of the universe begin to think -- about all the gods and mysteries . and there 's no room , for the mystical creatures , the commands by the divine expect .
it 's the dawn of rational idea of humanism , and the people started to believe that creativity is completely off your own individual coming .
i first in history you can hear people , or those artist , a genius , call -- instead of that he 's a genius .
i must tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think , a sensation merely a person to allow that he thinks , he or she was like this <unk> what the pelvis and the essence , and the source of divinity , creative , <unk> , an infinite , is a little bit too much responsibility to move them a <unk> , human psyche <unk> .
it 's how someone to ask , the sun to swallow .
this <unk> and distorted by the ego and it generates all these <unk> expectations of the success .
i think that this <unk> our artists from the last 500 years , having destroyed .
and , if it 's true , -- and i think , it 's true -- is the question :
do we change ?
maybe to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and the mystery of creative and return .
maybe not .
maybe we know it <unk> from 500 years , rational idea of humanism , not just in a <unk> talk to eradicate poverty .
and there 's sure people in this audience that are really exaggerated , science too hard to register to something about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , the people <unk> and <unk> on their projects , etc . work .
i 'm probably not all of them on this journey can take away .
but the question that i letting the point is : why not ?
why not so think about ?
because it as much sense like everything else that i 've heard , it was that are absolutely crazy <unk> <unk> of creative process to explain .
a process to the -- like everybody knows , it ever has tried , something to make -- so in other words : actually , here -- not always make reasonable behave .
in fact , it can , sometimes , literally <unk> feel .
i had recently , such an encounter , when i the most extraordinary american beat poet <unk> stone , i met , well over 90 is , but your life , a poet . they told me that you when the <unk> virginia , growing out the fields work . she said , they would feel and to listen as a poem by the landscape on them <unk> .
she said it would like a <unk> move from air ,
the about this country , they <unk> would .
they felt , if it came , because it would the planet among their feet to <unk> bring .
they knew that you in such a moment , only one could do . and this was -- in her words -- <unk> like the <unk> .
they ran out how the devil got to the house while it from this poem that tracks was . it was only about that she quickly enough to a sheet , and a pen to get you had to make it , if it through them through <unk> to capture , and the blank document i could .
, paint it was not fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , but they reached the house , and the poem by rolling down through them through and you missed it . she said it would be moving across country go and -- how they said -- <unk> another one day poet <unk> .
and then there were these moments -- the part i 'll never forget -- they said that 's moments , there in which it 's almost over missed .
so , she runs to the house and looking for the paper and the poem goes through them through and she reaches a pen , right when it through them <unk> and then -- she said -- it was so when i was going to the other hand , and then pick up and it to put the wars .
they <unk> the poem in its tail and moved it back in your body and it 's took on the paper .
in these opportunities that came the poem <unk> and intact , on paper on -- but it backwards -- from last word for the first .
when i think that sounded like i thought , `` that 's creepy , that is exactly how to my creative process <unk>
this is not like my creative process -- i 'm not the channel .
i 'm a <unk> . to work to be able to me every day , the same time up and sweat , i was earning and indeed , right <unk> .
but even i in my <unk> 've sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i suppose that many of them that 's also have done .
even i had to work or ideas , from a source of me <unk> , i do n't identify you can .
what is that for a thing ?
and how are we do in the relationship with no about our minds to lose , but it makes us in the opposite , even in mental health to do ?
for me is the living example , how do that i could do the musician , tom <unk> . i letting him a few years ago for a magazine , and interview .
we talked about getting on this topic . and you know what ? the for most of his life was tom the embodiment of jostling modern artist , trying to these <unk> creative impulses that in him four-year-old , to master and to cope .
but then he was older and quiet . he told me that he 's one day on a <unk> in los angeles start off . and there , everything changed for him .
he went with high speed as he got a patch of a melody , you hear that , how it in my inspirations are often is , for him a miserably hard is tangible . and he wants to have them . it is gorgeous . he <unk> then , but it can you do n't believe .
he has no paper , he has n't a pen , it has n't <unk> .
he starts so , those old <unk> in him rising , like , `` i 'm going to this thing to lose and i 'm from this song on forever a video analytics are .
i 'm not good enough , i 'm able to it <unk>
but instead of panic and post-modernism , he heard just pick up .
he ended up all the rather , and doing something completely new .
he looked out in the sky and said , <unk> , you ca n't see that i car to drive ? ''
<unk> i like when i could just a song phrase ?
if you really exist want to come up to a <unk> at once again , when i went to you care can .
if not , <unk> today , someone else .
go and <unk> leonard <unk>
his whole <unk> , then we 've changed .
not the work itself . that was still many times as dark , jesus , and ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that he surrounds himself , was salvaged when he 's genius from out went , where he would n't know when anger that caused and going to <unk> where he was making it came . he realized that 's no <unk> , <unk> thing must be .
it was a <unk> , some miraculous , bizarre about working to build a kind of conversation and tom , and the <unk> , <unk> thing that 's not quite tom 's been .
when i this story i 've heard that changed it a little bit of the way that i started sketching and it got me ever had saved .
this idea that saved me when i right in <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> was . i fell in one of <unk> of <unk> in the we all fail , if we look at some work and it does n't . you <unk> on to think that 's a disaster . this is the worst sketch artist book , that ever was written .
not just bad , but instead of the worst ever .
i started to think , i would like this project , just <unk> .
but then i remembered it , like tom , in the free to heaven and she had and i tried it .
i raised so my view from the manuscript , and talked my comment on in towards an empty the corner of the room .
i spoke to shout `` stop complaining , you thing you and i know each instance , if this book , not brilliant , this is that 's not complete my fault , is , right ?
because you see , that i do everything , what i , <unk> . i have no longer than that .
if you get it so much we have you want to do we have here <unk> and your stake in the <unk> <unk> .
okay . but , if you do n't do -- you know what , for the devil with .
i 'm still kept writing , because this is my job .
and i want to ask protocol , give me to go today for my bit of jobs here <unk>
because -- at it 's like . centuries ago , in the deserts <unk> people to <unk> with the holy dances , and music , gathered around that hours , and ceremony held by -- to <unk> .
these rigid were getting amazing , because the dancer who were highly professional and they were fantastic .
but , and go back , very rare , was something special . one of the performer is was actually <unk> .
and i know that you know , what i mean , because i know that they all in your life ever been such a <unk> have seen .

and very suddenly appeared he 's no longer just been brought human .
he was from the lights and from below lights and everything <unk> , through a <unk> fire .
when it was happening , did the people what was . they called it at his name .
they put the hands together and began to sing : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , <unk>
this is god , you know ?
interesting historical as a gloss : when the <unk> <unk> <unk> they brought this practice , with . the <unk> changed , over the centuries of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that is still in <unk> and <unk> hear .
if a performer , in spain , something <unk> , something magic did : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> 's amazing , there is it : a transient look at god .
and that 's amazing , because we need that .
but , the tricky part of the following the next morning , if the dancer who wakes up and recognizes that 's 11 o'clock at a tuesday -- is -- and he 's no longer a <unk> of god in the attached .
he is merely a <unk> mortal with <unk> kneel . and maybe he 'll never come back to these heights of rising .
and maybe will never again , god 's names are calling , when he proved to spin . but what it 's going to the rest of his life begin ?
that 's hard .
this is one of <unk> corrections at a creative life .
but maybe it does not quite as full <unk> be , if you from the beginning of not believed i have to the <unk> aspects of your <unk> of you could move .

if we start , like to think of changes all this .
so what i began to think , and so i think with safety in the last month , while i the the book working , that soon find out , is -- as the most dangerous , <unk> to be expected <unk> my <unk> success .
what i always interested to tell you have , if i think about this crazy 'm going to is : did n't afraid .
do n't be discourages people .
just do your job .
i thought would continue for your contribution , whatever he would be an ancient .
if your job that dance is , dancing .
if you do that stupid divine genius , that you to support the question is to decide , for a short of this is a <unk> by miracles through your efforts to show , then <unk> now ''
and if not , i 'm dancing in spite of your dance .
and <unk> '' -- for you -- despite the top .
i believe , and i feel that we should be the teachings .
<unk> '' -- for you -- despite the top , just for you to the mere human universal love and the <unk> did , that person .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i have these slides just showed up to illustrate that the <unk> <unk> , for nearly three million years of the size of the bottom up 48 states had to 40 percent of my lung health .
but these pressing , not very strongly enough to the seriousness , this particular problem , there 's not the thickness of ice is .
in a sense , is the <unk> <unk> that beating heart of our global <unk> .
it dwells in winter and <unk> in summer .
the next slide that i 'll show , is a <unk> what the past 25 years happened .
this <unk> is to red is marked .
as you see , growing , it on the <unk> tagged , this is the date of ice in the wintertime ; and it <unk> in summer .
this so-called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which the body , here <unk> .
in 25 years , it from here , here to be gone .
this is a problem , because the warming the frozen reason to the arctic sea <unk> , where it very large amounts of <unk> carbon , there , which , when he <unk> , of microbes , methane , middle-class unit will .
comparing with the total amount of <unk> materials in the atmosphere , could , this amount of double , if we have this critical moment that cross .
already today <unk> in some of flat , lakes in alaska , methane itself from the water .
professor <unk> walter university in alaska 's a lock and modeling to another one shallow seas in the last winter , i went .
wow !
she 's good . the question is , how it allows us <unk> .
and one reason is , this huge contains warmed the greenland from the north .
this is a a <unk> .
but the volume , are much bigger than ever .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> greenland .
if you want to know how the sea through <unk> up here <unk> you to sea .
those rivers , let 's rapidly to .

last month had signed a researcher at the entire continent now a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> , about a couple <unk> showed is , is particularly powerful in the melting .
that 's equivalent to 20 feet <unk> , greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> , you see up to be lakes , the front of a few years of glaciers were .
forty percent of people in the world get the half its <unk> out of this snowmelt from .
in the andes , is this glacier , the <unk> for this town .

but if you <unk> , it also that most of water <unk> .
in california was a 40 <unk> reduction in <unk> the sierra seen .
this is among the <unk> .
and the predictions , as you read , are seriously .
this <unk> in the world 's conducive to a dramatic spike on fire .
and the catastrophe , over the world have in a really <unk> and before unprecedented <unk> gained .
times as many in the last 30 years , like in the <unk> 75 .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you this in the historical terms of yourself , you can see , what it <unk> .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 produced at all of 24 hours -- 25 million tons daily in the oceans .

the largest single factor for the global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent of mind , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is that 's nevertheless biggest problem .
the united states are one or the largest <unk> , with china .
and the suggestion was , many more <unk> to build .
but we start to a change to see .
here are the , in the last painted by , with some green are alternatives , the department .
<unk> there 's a political struggle in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have a <unk> dollars last <unk> spent to clean coal to promote , which , in a contradiction in , is .
this reminded me of something .
the christmas around and passed , with me to home in tennessee , a billion tons <unk> out .
they have it <unk> in the news seen .
this is in our entire country that the <unk> <unk> america .
this happened to christmas .
one of the ads , the <unk> the christmas , was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happier fellow .
it 's in the shell and wealth in america , and he helps our economy to expand .
<unk> , the <unk> going to every day , clean .
he is affordable , and <unk> , and the workers to stay in wages , and this bread .
this is the source of coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the director of massey coal .
they let me a very clear to say , al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , they do n't know , what they talk .
so , the alliance for <unk> two , campaign in an argentinean .
this is one , a part of her .

so we have it us to the top <unk> hey , a significant <unk> spend a to <unk> on the way to bring the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal is n't really messy .
we think , it 's clean -- and smelly , even more good .

assuming it 's quiet for us .
<unk> coal , they have a lot about this .
so , let 's a tour of modern , clean <unk> do .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it 's the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet this burning of coal in the main reasons for the global warming is , the most notable enough clean <unk> , you see here , changes everything .
you take it , right , this is the world today , clean <unk> .
finally he blends the positive alternative to our economic challenge and our challenge the national security .
america 's a crisis in the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the major thread , this all together , is our dependence of <unk> <unk> like the same dirty and coal and <unk> oil .
but now there 's a courageous , new solutions to us from this <unk> able to remove themselves .
<unk> america to 100 percent cleaner , electricity , again , in our next 10 years .
a plan , america , back to work to get to us safer , and to help , the global warming , to stop .
finally , a solution that 's large enough , our to solve problems .
<unk> america in new . they 're carrying out .
this is the last .
it 's about a <unk> of america .

the future is here . wind , the sun and a new insecure .
new investment , well , paid for jobs to create .
<unk> america in new . it 's time , reality to accept .
there 's an old african proverb that , `` if you be fast you want to go alone .
if you go so far you want to go together . ''
we need to go so far , and that as fast .
thank you .
so i 'd begin to ask them , at the time your childhood <unk> , when you with <unk> aaah .
while they realized how to the hands <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> views and moves , we learned when they actually , to think , and problems through the understanding and change spatialized context or to solve .
the spatial can think is intimately that connect with , a lot of our environment to understand .
when <unk> -- inspired by the kind of our minds interacting with a physical objects -- it with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> <unk> , i began to be wondering : what would , if we use computers were , instead of <unk> to the like a digital <unk> on a flat <unk> moves -- what if some of us with both hands to intervene could and data , physically reinventing and they like to mandate , could , it want ?
this question was so intense that we 're going to explore the answer to credit and <unk> developed .
in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of <unk> .
you can start with the driver 's being moved , you can find mutually exclusive to sense , you can expect them to capture and they have a screen and a <unk> .
more importantly , they 're physically , why you how <unk> merely by the stick out of hands and tap can move .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools <unk> , and a conscious to expect them evolve , to each of see , and the intricacies of our <unk> with you see , then we up with the study of new and <unk> <unk> start .
i 'll begin with some simple design examples of .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> and if i asked him in a direction <unk> , is the video went ahead trolley system ; if i asked him in the other way <unk> , stepping it backwards .
and this interactive portraits , i’m going to each case .
i turn it so next leave that , lights that you very much .
if you <unk> are surrounded , notice it 's also , and you can little nervous .
and they feel like with their movements and entrepreneurial .
an interesting a result of interactions , we 're going to see it started , was that we keep everyday gestures on the data is a drone could , as color so to <unk> how to this with <unk> does .
in this case we are three <unk> as <unk> <unk> and i can use them to paint in the in the center to pour , where they then mixed use .
if we do it is exaggerated , we can be a little <unk> .
there 's also , even some nice and opportunities in education , how many languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we people the possibility of avoided <unk> give and the result now to see .
i 'm here -- that 's a <unk> that i do a simple <unk> programs .
this is a game with words , but this type of a mixture of <unk> and <unk> is .

then , after about 30 seconds , then mixed and you have a new <unk> and new ways to try .
thank you .
that are some kids who were on a trip to the media lab , coming . i could you make it to try and i 've got a video of recorded .
they have it really loved .
an interesting a situation in this kind of applications is that you to people not a lot of instructions , there must be .
everything else you tell you have is `` it forms of words , '' and you know exactly what to do .
here are still a few people that 's test .

it turns out that he 's the <unk> just a pile i want .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted a <unk> for <unk> develop .
this is <unk> .

here 's let 's the sun <unk> .
the sun goes on
now , puts it 's a <unk> in the scene .
the <unk> <unk> .
good job ! yes !
by it 's the <unk> shake and them side , puts it could , the characters and interact to ...
-- his own story to invent .
hello !
it 's a story with open up and he can decide , how they evolved .
flying his cat .
the last example , for that i today i 've been , it to show , is a <unk> for <unk> that we recently have evolved and in the <unk> as a sound , <unk> , being basses and the drums , act .
each has four different variations ; you can choose , which you wants to use .
and you can these sounds in the sequence <unk> that you turn into any of pattern to mandate that .
and you <unk> you a , by you just a <unk> at a <unk> happen .
there are the effects that you live , we can change , like . hall and filter .
you connect him with a particular sound , and tends to him , to hire .
and then there <unk> effects , like this pace , and the volume , you on the entire sequence of exercise .
so let me .
we start , where we the <unk> in two <unk> <unk> and this in a row to mandate , you dilate , and a little bit more about the voice or dates .
now <unk> i a bass , along .
now i 'm still a play drums , to do .
and now just hook , i the filters to the drums , so i the effect live , we could fly .
i can the entire sequence that speed , by i was the rate in the one or another way <unk> .
and now just hook , i the filter , with the bass , for something more terrified .
i can the sequence , while they 're headed to god forbid .
so i have you 're not the plan , they can truly improvising as it 's a reclusive prolong people or to shrink .
and finally , in the entire sequence <unk> , by , i <unk> to left hyperbole .
thank you .
so as you can see that 's my passion at the new <unk> to . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .develop the better to the suit , like our brains and bodies to work .
and today , i had time , you a part of these new <unk> and some of possibilities about what 's going to what we in our lab to work .
the thought , i them with the want to leave , is that we on the cusp of this new generation of <unk> to interact with digital media are , the information in our world to bring that our different wrinkles in somalia .
thank you ,
i 'm pleased to the conversation with you all !
